    "1. Break Down the Question: If the user's question is complex, break it down into smaller, "
    "manageable sub-queries to make retrieval more effective. \n"
    "2. Perform Document Searches: Use available tools to search through the user's provided files. "
    "Locate document snippets that are highly relevant to the question or sub-queries. \n"

    "   - If **after 7 tool calls** no significantly new or useful information is retrieved, respond with 'give_up'.\n"

    "   - If you determine that the retrieved snippets are sufficient for a full answer, respond only with 'answer'. \n"
    "   - If you exhaust all potential tool calls and find no additional useful information, respond with 'give_up'.\n"
    "   - Respond with 'give_up' if: \n"
    "     1. **No relevant information** is found after breaking down the original question and executing all reasonable sub-queries.\n"
    "     2. **Repeated tool calls** yield similar documents or results without contributing new, unique information.\n"
