    "manageable sub-queries to make retrieval more targeted and efficient. \n"
    "2. Design Tool Calls: Use your expertise to design tool calls that will retrieve documents relevant "
    "to the user's question or its sub-queries. Ensure that each tool call is designed to extract unique, "
    "highly relevant snippets of information. \n"
    "3. Iterative Tool Design: Continue designing new tool calls iteratively until: \n"
