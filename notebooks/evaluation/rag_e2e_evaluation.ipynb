Studies have shown that receiving UBI-like payments in childhood can reduce the probability of obesity. Research has indicated that for every $5,000 increase in annual household income, the likelihood of obesity reduced by 2-4% at age 21. Additionally, exploring the association between cash transfers and substance use is crucial in understanding how UBI-like payments may influence obesity rates. Sources: Milovanska-Farrington, S. (2020), Gibson et al. (2018), Mendelson M. (2019).', expected_output='In Alaska, longitudinal administrative data was used to explore whether variations in the value of UBI-like payments affected childhood obesity rates. This was possible as Alaskan payments vary annually with oil prices, and researchers were therefore able to explore whether differences in the cumulative amount received by age 3 affected obesity status. In doing so, they identified that controlling for all other variables, an additional $1,000 in accumulated payments reduced the relative probability of being obese as a three-year old by 5.2 percentage points (Watson, Guettabi & Reimer, 2019). Similarly, in Western Carolina researchers found that receiving UBI-like payments in childhood reduced the probability of obesity by 2- 4% at age 21 for every $5,000 increase in annual household income (Akee et al. 2013). However, it must be noted that these findings varied according to initial household socio- economic status, with an initial increase in BMI among children from lower income households.', context=[\"[' particular significance, suggesting these payments accounted for at least some of the observed effect. As such, they suggest that UBI-style interventions introduced in childhood can not only hold immediate benefits for children’s mental health, but can also influence outcomes into adulthood, particularly if introduced early.\\\\n\\\\nMore specifically...\\\\n\\\\nproviding payments in a way which enables rather than prevents parents from spending\\\\n\\\\n®\\\\n\\\\nMental Health Foundation Scotland\\\\n\\\\n15.\\\\n\\\\nThe mental health effects of a universal basic income - Summary of study findings\\\\n\\\\nquality time with their children are of particular benefit.\\\\n\\\\nSuch findings may be of benefit to policymakers when considering welfare reforms with regard to children’s mental health outcomes.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nin Dauphin during the MINCOME pilot of the 1970’s. MINCOME payments were not universal, nor were they individual, however they were granted to low-income households regardless of employment status, and 30% of Dauphin residents ultimately received them during the trial.

In Ontario a large percentage of recipients reported reductions in visits to health practitioners (33%) and hospital emergency rooms (37%) (Ferdosi et al. 2020). Conversely, in Finland, no difference in the reported number of hospital attendances or general practitioner visits were observed between groups (Kela, 2020).\\\\n\\\\nFurther analysis identified this reduction was primarily due to a significant fall in the number of admissions related to “accidents and injuries” and “mental health diagnoses”. Physician visits were also noticed to follow a similar trend, with a significant reduction in visits related to mental health diagnoses for the duration of the pilot. In addition, the decline in Dauphin hospitalisation rates relative to rates in the surrounding areas stopped when the trial ended, indicating MINCOME payments were at least partially driving these changes.

This was possible as Alaskan payments vary annually with oil prices, and researchers were therefore able to explore whether differences in the cumulative amount received by age 3 affected obesity status. In doing so, they identified that...\\\\n\\\\ncontrolling for all other variables, an additional $1,000 in accumulated payments reduced the relative probability of being obese as a three-year old by 5.2 percentage points\\\\n\\\\n(Watson', ', Guettabi & Reimer, 2019).\\\\n\\\\nSimilarly, in Western Carolina researchers found that receiving UBI-like payments in childhood reduced the probability of obesity by 2- 4% at age 21 for every $5,000 increase in annual household income (Akee et al. 2013). However, it must be noted that these findings varied according to initial household socio- economic status, with an initial increase in BMI among children from lower income households. The authors concluded this suggests that not all of the negative effects of childhood poverty can be addressed by UBI. These observations also support the findings of recent study which analysed longitudinal data collected in Scotland and identified a positive association between maternal hours worked and child BMI, in addition\\\\n\\\\nto an increase in the likelihood of children being overweight or obese with increasing maternal hours worked (Milovanska- Farrington, 2020).\\\\n\\\\nAs policymakers and others often express concern that poor households may use UBI-like payments to buy tobacco, alcohol and other recreational substances, exploring the association between cash transfers and substance use is an area of particular interest (Gibson et al. 2018). Previous reviews of cash transfers in LMIC have identified that total expenditures on temptation goods actually reduce in response to UBI, suggesting that concerns about the use of cash transfers for alcohol and tobacco are unfounded (Evans & Popova, 2014). Yet few studies exploring the effects of cash transfers on drug or alcohol consumption in High Income Countries have been conducted (Gibson et al. 2018). A survey of cash transfer recipients in Ontario did identify that almost half (48%) reported a reduction in alcohol consumption. It has also been hypothesised that the large reduction in hospital attendances for “accidents and injuries” observed in Dauphin during the MINCOME pilot, may reflect a reduction in alcohol misuse (Forget, 2011). In addition, the findings from Western Carolina, where, as previously discussed, a reduction in the prevalence of substance use disorders amongst young adults\\\\n\\\\nwho had received UBI like payments\\\\n\\\\nsince childhood was identified, suggest\\\\n\\\\npayments may contribute to reducing\\\\n\\\\nsubstance misuse. However, other studies\\\\n\\\\nhave identified that infrequent, high value\\\\n\\\\n® Mental Health Foundation Scotland\\\\n\\\\n18.\\\\n\\\\nThe mental health effects of a universal basic income - Summary of study findings\\\\n\\\\npayments appear to lead to temporary spikes in the consumption of substances with implied benefits in staggering payments over the year (Evans & Moore, 2011\", ' Watson, Guettabi & Reimer, 2020).\\\\n\\\\nGiven Scotland’s unique relationship with alcohol and other recreational substances, clearly further research is needed to establish how the population may respond to such a form of social provision. However, these preliminary findings suggest the impact of UBI on drug consumption is largely influenced by the length of exposure to and the value of, cash transfers, with staggered payments beginning in childhood appearing to have\\\\n\\\\na beneficial effect.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nsocial divide (Tory & Jenner, 2019). Our\\\\n\\\\nfindings go some way to supporting this theory, with reports of increased social participation, reduced perceptions of stigma and enhanced relationships with family and friends being cited in several of the identified studies. In Finland, significant reductions in feelings of loneliness and an increased confidence in one’s ability to influence societal matters (28.9% vs 22.6%, p<0.0001) were found among recipients compared with controls (Kela, 2020). Similarly, in the Netherlands, enhanced perceptions of freedom, autonomy and social integration were identified during interviews with recipients who had had the conditionality associated with their benefits removed (Kool, 2019), while in Barcelona time spent on social activities or with family and friends significantly increased among recipients (Kirchner et al. 2019). A survey of recipients from Ontario also found improvements in social engagement, through increased time with family (57%) or on recreational activities (63%), as well as an increased sense of dignity (61%) and a reduction in feelings of marginalisation (47%) (Basic Income Canada Network, 2019). Finally, a qualitative evaluation of MINCOME identified widespread reports of psychological distress as a result of the\\\\n\\\\nSocial Cohesion and Social Participation\\\\n\\\\nperceived social stigma associated with\\\\n\\\\nreceiving traditional welfare benefits.\\\\n\\\\nThis contrasted with the experiences\\\\n\\\\nAccording to proponents, one of the key benefits of UBI is its unique ability to enhance social cohesion through reducing poverty stigma and narrowing the growing\\\\n\\\\nof MINCOME recipients, who reported\\\\n\\\\nincreased social participation and a\\\\n\\\\nlarge reduction in feelings of shame and\\\\n\\\\nstigma due to the avoidance of having\\\\n\\\\n®\\\\n\\\\nMental Health Foundation Scotland\\\\n\\\\n19.\\\\n\\\\nThe mental health effects of a universal basic income - Summary of study findings\\\\n\\\\ntheir work and personal lives monitored (The Young Foundation, 2019', \"2020).

In Scotland, where close to a quarter of all children and a fifth of ‘working age’ adults live in poverty, public and political interest in UBI is growing. There is therefore a need for evidence on the potential benefits and drawbacks of the policy.\\\\n\\\\nUnfortunately, given the limited available evidence, it is not possible to draw any conclusions on the potential benefits or pitfalls of universal cash transfers. However, several pilots did directly compare the mental health effects of conditional versus unconditional cash transfers and their findings are striking. For adults, studies consistently found that removing the conditions associated with traditional welfare benefits was associated with improved mental wellbeing among participants, suggesting this holds considerable gains for population mental health. From a reduction in reported feelings of stress, symptoms of psychiatric disorder and perceptions of stigma and marginalisation, to overall improvements in mental wellbeing and better cognitive functioning, studies consistently reported clear and significant improvements in mental health when the conditionality\\\\n\\\\nremoved or replaced with more supportive, tailored, unconditional interventions.\\\\n\\\\nFurthermore, while UBI opponents assert\\\\n\\\\nthat the conditions associated with traditional welfare benefits are necessary in order to ensure individuals are motivated to return to work, in the studies we identified the removal of conditionality had no effect on either the rate of employment amongst recipients or their motivation for and attempts to secure it. Although the current review is limited to the previous UBI pilots, these findings echo the results of other benefit sanction reviews. In 2016, a comprehensive review by the National Audit Office concluded there was limited evidence sanctions actually worked and concluded the sanctions system was in urgent need of reform (National Audit Office, 2016). More recently, in the most extensive study of welfare conditionality in the UK ever conducted, sanctions were overall found to be ineffective at getting jobless people into work (Economic and Social Research Council [ESRC], 2018). Moreover, it emerged that they do little to enhance motivation to find employment and for some individuals, increase their risk of exposure to further poverty, ill-health and even survival crime (ESRC, 2018). Apportioning benefit sanctions based on the failure to comply with the current conditionality attached to Universal Credit would therefore appear\\\\n\\\\nassociated with traditional welfare was\\\\n\\\\nnot only detrimental to mental wellbeing,\\\\n\\\\n®\\\\n\\\\nMental Health Foundation Scotland\\\\n\\\\n21.\\\\n\\\\nThe mental health effects of a universal basic income - Conclusions\\\\n\\\\nbut also potentially harmful, ineffective and unnecessary.\\\\n\\\\nThere was also some preliminary evidence to suggest that removing conditionality is associated with a decrease in healthcare utilisation and reduction in health-risk behaviours, including alcohol and substance misuse. However more rigorous research is needed in order to definitively establish this, as well as further studies to determine the particular tenets of UBI which contribute to these reductions. Nonetheless, given the staggering human and financial cost of hospital admissions, as well as drug and alcohol misuse in Scotland, these results are of considerable interest.\\\\n\\\\nFinally, in the studies of unconditional cash transfers for children, we identified significant and long-lasting benefits in their mental health, particularly when these were introduced early. The detrimental effects of growing up in poverty for children’s mental health and overall development are well known. However, findings from Western Carolina indicate that income changes in isolation did not significantly mediate improved mental health outcomes for children. Rather it was increased parental supervision and an improvement in parent-child relationships due to reduced time constraints within the family which were central. As such, Scotland’s efforts to improve children’s mental wellbeing through reducing childhood poverty will be ineffective if the wider effects of all policies on children’s wellbeing are not evaluated. This must therefore be carefully considered\\\\n\\\\nmost effective strategies for improving children’s wellbeing, with implications that providing low-income households with non-stigmatising, unconditional payments offers parents the opportunity to spend more quality time with their children, with significant and long-lasting benefits.\\\\n\\\\nIn summary, it was not the purpose of this review to explore the economic impact or affordability of UBI, or indeed its ability to lift people out of poverty, rather our aim was to explore the impact of UBI-like schemes on mental health and wellbeing. Although none of the identified studies evaluated the mental health effects of a UBI in its purest sense, given none of these pilots were truly universal, our findings add an important contribution to our understanding of how the current welfare system could be improved to better support everyone’s mental health.

MINCOME payments were not universal, nor were they individual, however they were granted to low-income households regardless of employment status, and 30% of Dauphin residents ultimately received them during the trial.

In Ontario a large percentage of recipients reported reductions in visits to health practitioners (33%) and hospital emergency rooms (37%) (Ferdosi et al. 2020). Conversely, in Finland, no difference in the reported number of hospital attendances or general practitioner visits were observed between groups (Kela, 2020).\\\\n\\\\nFurther analysis identified this reduction was primarily due to a significant fall in the number of admissions related to “accidents and injuries” and “mental health diagnoses”. Physician visits were also noticed to follow a similar trend, with a significant reduction in visits related to mental health diagnoses for the duration of the pilot. In addition, the decline in Dauphin hospitalisation rates relative to rates in the surrounding areas stopped when the trial ended, indicating MINCOME payments were at least partially driving these changes. For policymakers in Scotland, where mental health and drug- related hospital admissions continue to soar, on a purely economic level, these findings\\\\n\\\\nHowever, of particular interest is the work of Forget (2011) who used health administration data to examine whether any changes in healthcare utilisation occurred\\\\n\\\\nshould be of considerable interest.\\\\n\\\\n®\\\\n\\\\nMental Health Foundation Scotland\\\\n\\\\n16.\\\\n\\\\nThe mental health effects of a universal basic income - Summary of study findings\\\\n\\\\nFig. 1 - Hospitalisations per 1000 people by fiscal year.

The human and economic costs of such health risk behaviours are vast. In Scotland specifically, where childhood obesity is endemic (Milovanska-Farrington, 2020) and drug related deaths are the highest in Europe (Nicholls et al. 2019), this is an area of particular interest where relatively small changes on an individual level may have wide ranging implications for population health. In addition, the link between physical health and wellbeing is well established and as such these findings are also pertinent to policymakers interested in the mental health effects of UBI.\\\\n\\\\nWhile not the focus of this review, a smaller number of the studies we reviewed explored\\\\n\\\\n®\\\\n\\\\nMental Health Foundation Scotland\\\\n\\\\n17.\\\\n\\\\nThe mental health effects of a universal basic income - Summary of study findings\\\\n\\\\nIn Alaska, longitudinal administrative data was used to explore whether variations in the value of UBI-like payments affected childhood obesity rates.

However, it must be noted that these findings varied according to initial household socio- economic status, with an initial increase in BMI among children from lower income households. The authors concluded this suggests that not all of the negative effects of childhood poverty can be addressed by UBI. These observations also support the findings of recent study which analysed longitudinal data collected in Scotland and identified a positive association between maternal hours worked and child BMI, in addition\\\\n\\\\nto an increase in the likelihood of children being overweight or obese with increasing maternal hours worked (Milovanska- Farrington, 2020).\\\\n\\\\nAs policymakers and others often express concern that poor households may use UBI-like payments to buy tobacco, alcohol and other recreational substances, exploring the association between cash transfers and substance use is an area of particular interest (Gibson et al. 2018). Previous reviews of cash transfers in LMIC have identified that total expenditures on temptation goods actually reduce in response to UBI, suggesting that concerns about the use of cash transfers for alcohol and tobacco are unfounded (Evans & Popova, 2014). Yet few studies exploring the effects of cash transfers on drug or alcohol consumption in High Income Countries have been conducted (Gibson et al. 2018). A survey of cash transfer recipients in Ontario did identify that almost half (48%) reported a reduction in alcohol consumption. It has also been hypothesised that the large reduction in hospital attendances for “accidents and injuries” observed in Dauphin during the MINCOME pilot, may reflect a reduction in alcohol misuse (Forget, 2011). In addition, the findings from Western Carolina, where, as previously discussed, a reduction in the prevalence of substance use disorders amongst young adults\\\\n\\\\nwho had received UBI like payments\\\\n\\\\nsince childhood was identified, suggest\\\\n\\\\npayments may contribute to reducing\\\\n\\\\nsubstance misuse. However, other studies\\\\n\\\\nhave identified that infrequent, high value\\\\n\\\\n® Mental Health Foundation Scotland\\\\n\\\\n18.\\\\n\\\\nThe mental health effects of a universal basic income - Summary of study findings\\\\n\\\\npayments appear to lead to temporary spikes in the consumption of substances with implied benefits in staggering payments over the year (Evans & Moore, 2011\", ' Watson, Guettabi & Reimer, 2020).\\\\n\\\\nGiven Scotland’s unique relationship with alcohol and other recreational substances, clearly further research is needed to establish how the population may respond to such a form of social provision. However, these preliminary findings suggest the impact of UBI on drug consumption is largely influenced by the length of exposure to and the value of, cash transfers, with staggered payments beginning in childhood appearing to have\\\\n\\\\na beneficial effect.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nsocial divide (Tory & Jenner, 2019). Our\\\\n\\\\nfindings go some way to supporting this theory, with reports of increased social participation, reduced perceptions of stigma and enhanced relationships with family and friends being cited in several of the identified studies. In Finland, significant reductions in feelings of loneliness and an increased confidence in one’s ability to influence societal matters (28.9% vs 22.6%, p<0.0001) were found among recipients compared with controls (Kela, 2020). Similarly, in the Netherlands, enhanced perceptions of freedom, autonomy and social integration were identified during interviews with recipients who had had the conditionality associated with their benefits removed (Kool, 2019), while in Barcelona time spent on social activities or with family and friends significantly increased among recipients (Kirchner et al. 2019). A survey of recipients from Ontario also found improvements in social engagement, through increased time with family (57%) or on recreational activities (63%), as well as an increased sense of dignity (61%) and a reduction in feelings of marginalisation (47%) (Basic Income Canada Network, 2019).

MINCOME payments were not universal, nor were they individual, however they were granted to low-income households regardless of employment status, and 30% of Dauphin residents ultimately received them during the trial. The aim of this study was therefore to explore whether this change in the conditionality associated with receiving social security benefits had any spillover effects for wider population health in Dauphin, compared with surrounding areas where no such change occurred. In doing so it was identified that...\\\\n\\\\nhospital admissions reduced by 8.5% during the trial in comparison with surrounding local areas.\\\\n\\\\nMental Health Service Utilisation\\\\n\\\\nFew studies have rigorously explored the effects of UBI on mental health service utilisation, and self-reported service use among recipients from cross-sectional surveys have produced conflicting results. In Ontario a large percentage of recipients reported reductions in visits to health practitioners (33%) and hospital emergency rooms (37%) (Ferdosi et al. 2020). Conversely, in Finland, no difference in the reported number of hospital attendances or general practitioner visits were observed between groups (Kela, 2020).\\\\n\\\\nFurther analysis identified this reduction was primarily due to a significant fall in the number of admissions related to “accidents and injuries” and “mental health diagnoses”. Physician visits were also noticed to follow a similar trend, with a significant reduction in visits related to mental health diagnoses for the duration of the pilot. In addition, the decline in Dauphin hospitalisation rates relative to rates in the surrounding areas stopped when the trial ended, indicating MINCOME payments were at least partially driving these changes. For policymakers in Scotland, where mental health and drug- related hospital admissions continue to soar, on a purely economic level, these findings\\\\n\\\\nHowever, of particular interest is the work of Forget (2011) who used health administration data to examine whether any changes in healthcare utilisation occurred\\\\n\\\\nshould be of considerable interest.\\\\n\\\\n®\\\\n\\\\nMental Health Foundation Scotland\\\\n\\\\n16.\\\\n\\\\nThe mental health effects of a universal basic income - Summary of study findings\\\\n\\\\nFig. 1 - Hospitalisations per 1000 people by fiscal year.

The human and economic costs of such health risk behaviours are vast. In Scotland specifically, where childhood obesity is endemic (Milovanska-Farrington, 2020) and drug related deaths are the highest in Europe (Nicholls et al. 2019), this is an area of particular interest where relatively small changes on an individual level may have wide ranging implications for population health. In addition, the link between physical health and wellbeing is well established and as such these findings are also pertinent to policymakers interested in the mental health effects of UBI.\\\\n\\\\nWhile not the focus of this review, a smaller number of the studies we reviewed explored\\\\n\\\\n®\\\\n\\\\nMental Health Foundation Scotland\\\\n\\\\n17.\\\\n\\\\nThe mental health effects of a universal basic income - Summary of study findings\\\\n\\\\nIn Alaska, longitudinal administrative data was used to explore whether variations in the value of UBI-like payments affected childhood obesity rates. This was possible as Alaskan payments vary annually with oil prices, and researchers were therefore able to explore whether differences in the cumulative amount received by age 3 affected obesity status. In doing so, they identified that...\\\\n\\\\ncontrolling for all other variables, an additional $1,000 in accumulated payments reduced the relative probability of being obese as a three-year old by 5.2 percentage points\\\\n\\\\n(Watson', ', Guettabi & Reimer, 2019).\\\\n\\\\nSimilarly, in Western Carolina researchers found that receiving UBI-like payments in childhood reduced the probability of obesity by 2- 4% at age 21 for every $5,000 increase in annual household income (Akee et al. 2013). However, it must be noted that these findings varied according to initial household socio- economic status, with an initial increase in BMI among children from lower income households. The authors concluded this suggests that not all of the negative effects of childhood poverty can be addressed by UBI. These observations also support the findings of recent study which analysed longitudinal data collected in Scotland and identified a positive association between maternal hours worked and child BMI, in addition\\\\n\\\\nto an increase in the likelihood of children being overweight or obese with increasing maternal hours worked (Milovanska- Farrington, 2020).\\\\n\\\\nAs policymakers and others often express concern that poor households may use UBI-like payments to buy tobacco, alcohol and other recreational substances, exploring the association between cash transfers and substance use is an area of particular interest (Gibson et al. 2018). Previous reviews of cash transfers in LMIC have identified that total expenditures on temptation goods actually reduce in response to UBI, suggesting that concerns about the use of cash transfers for alcohol and tobacco are unfounded (Evans & Popova, 2014). Yet few studies exploring the effects of cash transfers on drug or alcohol consumption in High Income Countries have been conducted (Gibson et al. 2018). A survey of cash transfer recipients in Ontario did identify that almost half (48%) reported a reduction in alcohol consumption. It has also been hypothesised that the large reduction in hospital attendances for “accidents and injuries” observed in Dauphin during the MINCOME pilot, may reflect a reduction in alcohol misuse (Forget, 2011). In addition, the findings from Western Carolina, where, as previously discussed, a reduction in the prevalence of substance use disorders amongst young adults\\\\n\\\\nwho had received UBI like payments\\\\n\\\\nsince childhood was identified, suggest\\\\n\\\\npayments may contribute to reducing\\\\n\\\\nsubstance misuse. However, other studies\\\\n\\\\nhave identified that infrequent, high value\\\\n\\\\n® Mental Health Foundation Scotland\\\\n\\\\n18.\\\\n\\\\nThe mental health effects of a universal basic income - Summary of study findings\\\\n\\\\npayments appear to lead to temporary spikes in the consumption of substances with implied benefits in staggering payments over the year (Evans & Moore, 2011\", ' Watson, Guettabi & Reimer, 2020).\\\\n\\\\nGiven Scotland’s unique relationship with alcohol and other recreational substances, clearly further research is needed to establish how the population may respond to such a form of social provision. However, these preliminary findings suggest the impact of UBI on drug consumption is largely influenced by the length of exposure to and the value of, cash transfers, with staggered payments beginning in childhood appearing to have\\\\n\\\\na beneficial effect.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nsocial divide (Tory & Jenner, 2019). Our\\\\n\\\\nfindings go some way to supporting this theory, with reports of increased social participation, reduced perceptions of stigma and enhanced relationships with family and friends being cited in several of the identified studies. In Finland, significant reductions in feelings of loneliness and an increased confidence in one’s ability to influence societal matters (28.9% vs 22.6%, p<0.0001) were found among recipients compared with controls (Kela, 2020). Similarly, in the Netherlands, enhanced perceptions of freedom, autonomy and social integration were identified during interviews with recipients who had had the conditionality associated with their benefits removed (Kool, 2019), while in Barcelona time spent on social activities or with family and friends significantly increased among recipients (Kirchner et al. 2019). A survey of recipients from Ontario also found improvements in social engagement, through increased time with family (57%) or on recreational activities (63%), as well as an increased sense of dignity (61%) and a reduction in feelings of marginalisation (47%) (Basic Income Canada Network, 2019). Finally, a qualitative evaluation of MINCOME identified widespread reports of psychological distress as a result of the\\\\n\\\\nSocial Cohesion and Social Participation\\\\n\\\\nperceived social stigma associated with\\\\n\\\\nreceiving traditional welfare benefits.\\\\n\\\\nThis contrasted with the experiences\\\\n\\\\nAccording to proponents, one of the key benefits of UBI is its unique ability to enhance social cohesion through reducing poverty stigma and narrowing the growing\\\\n\\\\nof MINCOME recipients, who reported\\\\n\\\\nincreased social participation and a\\\\n\\\\nlarge reduction in feelings of shame and\\\\n\\\\nstigma due to the avoidance of having\\\\n\\\\n®\\\\n\\\\nMental Health Foundation Scotland\\\\n\\\\n19.\\\\n\\\\nThe mental health effects of a universal basic income - Summary of study findings\\\\n\\\\ntheir work and personal lives monitored (The Young Foundation, 2019', \"2020).

In Scotland, where close to a quarter of all children and a fifth of ‘working age’ adults live in poverty, public and political interest in UBI is growing. There is therefore a need for evidence on the potential benefits and drawbacks of the policy.\\\\n\\\\nUnfortunately, given the limited available evidence, it is not possible to draw any conclusions on the potential benefits or pitfalls of universal cash transfers. However, several pilots did directly compare the mental health effects of conditional versus unconditional cash transfers and their findings are striking. For adults, studies consistently found that removing the conditions associated with traditional welfare benefits was associated with improved mental wellbeing among participants, suggesting this holds considerable gains for population mental health. From a reduction in reported feelings of stress, symptoms of psychiatric disorder and perceptions of stigma and marginalisation, to overall improvements in mental wellbeing and better cognitive functioning, studies consistently reported clear and significant improvements in mental health when the conditionality\\\\n\\\\nremoved or replaced with more supportive, tailored, unconditional interventions.\\\\n\\\\nFurthermore, while UBI opponents assert\\\\n\\\\nthat the conditions associated with traditional welfare benefits are necessary in order to ensure individuals are motivated to return to work, in the studies we identified the removal of conditionality had no effect on either the rate of employment amongst recipients or their motivation for and attempts to secure it. Although the current review is limited to the previous UBI pilots, these findings echo the results of other benefit sanction reviews. In 2016, a comprehensive review by the National Audit Office concluded there was limited evidence sanctions actually worked and concluded the sanctions system was in urgent need of reform (National Audit Office, 2016). More recently, in the most extensive study of welfare conditionality in the UK ever conducted, sanctions were overall found to be ineffective at getting jobless people into work (Economic and Social Research Council [ESRC], 2018). Moreover, it emerged that they do little to enhance motivation to find employment and for some individuals, increase their risk of exposure to further poverty, ill-health and even survival crime (ESRC, 2018). Apportioning benefit sanctions based on the failure to comply with the current conditionality attached to Universal Credit would therefore appear\\\\n\\\\nassociated with traditional welfare was\\\\n\\\\nnot only detrimental to mental wellbeing,\\\\n\\\\n®\\\\n\\\\nMental Health Foundation Scotland\\\\n\\\\n21.\\\\n\\\\nThe mental health effects of a universal basic income - Conclusions\\\\n\\\\nbut also potentially harmful, ineffective and unnecessary.\\\\n\\\\nThere was also some preliminary evidence to suggest that removing conditionality is associated with a decrease in healthcare utilisation and reduction in health-risk behaviours, including alcohol and substance misuse. However more rigorous research is needed in order to definitively establish this, as well as further studies to determine the particular tenets of UBI which contribute to these reductions. Nonetheless, given the staggering human and financial cost of hospital admissions, as well as drug and alcohol misuse in Scotland, these results are of considerable interest.\\\\n\\\\nFinally, in the studies of unconditional cash transfers for children, we identified significant and long-lasting benefits in their mental health, particularly when these were introduced early. The detrimental effects of growing up in poverty for children’s mental health and overall development are well known. However, findings from Western Carolina indicate that income changes in isolation did not significantly mediate improved mental health outcomes for children. Rather it was increased parental supervision and an improvement in parent-child relationships due to reduced time constraints within the family which were central. As such, Scotland’s efforts to improve children’s mental wellbeing through reducing childhood poverty will be ineffective if the wider effects of all policies on children’s wellbeing are not evaluated. This must therefore be carefully considered\\\\n\\\\nmost effective strategies for improving children’s wellbeing, with implications that providing low-income households with non-stigmatising, unconditional payments offers parents the opportunity to spend more quality time with their children, with significant and long-lasting benefits.\\\\n\\\\nIn summary, it was not the purpose of this review to explore the economic impact or affordability of UBI, or indeed its ability to lift people out of poverty, rather our aim was to explore the impact of UBI-like schemes on mental health and wellbeing. Although none of the identified studies evaluated the mental health effects of a UBI in its purest sense, given none of these pilots were truly universal, our findings add an important contribution to our understanding of how the current welfare system could be improved to better support everyone’s mental health.

Studies have shown that receiving UBI-like payments in childhood can reduce the probability of obesity. Research has indicated that for every $5,000 increase in annual household income, the likelihood of obesity reduced by 2-4% at age 21. Additionally, exploring the association between cash transfers and substance use is crucial in understanding how UBI-like payments may influence obesity rates. Sources: Milovanska-Farrington, S.

In doing so, they identified that controlling for all other variables, an additional $1,000 in accumulated payments reduced the relative probability of being obese as a three-year old by 5.2 percentage points (Watson, Guettabi & Reimer, 2019). Similarly, in Western Carolina researchers found that receiving UBI-like payments in childhood reduced the probability of obesity by 2- 4% at age 21 for every $5,000 increase in annual household income (Akee et al. 2013).

MINCOME payments were not universal, nor were they individual, however they were granted to low-income households regardless of employment status, and 30% of Dauphin residents ultimately received them during the trial.

In Ontario a large percentage of recipients reported reductions in visits to health practitioners (33%) and hospital emergency rooms (37%) (Ferdosi et al. 2020). Conversely, in Finland, no difference in the reported number of hospital attendances or general practitioner visits were observed between groups (Kela, 2020).\\\\n\\\\nFurther analysis identified this reduction was primarily due to a significant fall in the number of admissions related to “accidents and injuries” and “mental health diagnoses”. Physician visits were also noticed to follow a similar trend, with a significant reduction in visits related to mental health diagnoses for the duration of the pilot. In addition, the decline in Dauphin hospitalisation rates relative to rates in the surrounding areas stopped when the trial ended, indicating MINCOME payments were at least partially driving these changes.

However, it must be noted that these findings varied according to initial household socio- economic status, with an initial increase in BMI among children from lower income households. The authors concluded this suggests that not all of the negative effects of childhood poverty can be addressed by UBI. These observations also support the findings of recent study which analysed longitudinal data collected in Scotland and identified a positive association between maternal hours worked and child BMI, in addition\\\\n\\\\nto an increase in the likelihood of children being overweight or obese with increasing maternal hours worked (Milovanska- Farrington, 2020).\\\\n\\\\nAs policymakers and others often express concern that poor households may use UBI-like payments to buy tobacco, alcohol and other recreational substances, exploring the association between cash transfers and substance use is an area of particular interest (Gibson et al. 2018). Previous reviews of cash transfers in LMIC have identified that total expenditures on temptation goods actually reduce in response to UBI, suggesting that concerns about the use of cash transfers for alcohol and tobacco are unfounded (Evans & Popova, 2014). Yet few studies exploring the effects of cash transfers on drug or alcohol consumption in High Income Countries have been conducted (Gibson et al. 2018). A survey of cash transfer recipients in Ontario did identify that almost half (48%) reported a reduction in alcohol consumption. It has also been hypothesised that the large reduction in hospital attendances for “accidents and injuries” observed in Dauphin during the MINCOME pilot, may reflect a reduction in alcohol misuse (Forget, 2011). In addition, the findings from Western Carolina, where, as previously discussed, a reduction in the prevalence of substance use disorders amongst young adults\\\\n\\\\nwho had received UBI like payments\\\\n\\\\nsince childhood was identified, suggest\\\\n\\\\npayments may contribute to reducing\\\\n\\\\nsubstance misuse.

However, these preliminary findings suggest the impact of UBI on drug consumption is largely influenced by the length of exposure to and the value of, cash transfers, with staggered payments beginning in childhood appearing to have\\\\n\\\\na beneficial effect.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nsocial divide (Tory & Jenner, 2019). Our\\\\n\\\\nfindings go some way to supporting this theory, with reports of increased social participation, reduced perceptions of stigma and enhanced relationships with family and friends being cited in several of the identified studies. In Finland, significant reductions in feelings of loneliness and an increased confidence in one’s ability to influence societal matters (28.9% vs 22.6%, p<0.0001) were found among recipients compared with controls (Kela, 2020). Similarly, in the Netherlands, enhanced perceptions of freedom, autonomy and social integration were identified during interviews with recipients who had had the conditionality associated with their benefits removed (Kool, 2019), while in Barcelona time spent on social activities or with family and friends significantly increased among recipients (Kirchner et al. 2019). A survey of recipients from Ontario also found improvements in social engagement, through increased time with family (57%) or on recreational activities (63%), as well as an increased sense of dignity (61%) and a reduction in feelings of marginalisation (47%) (Basic Income Canada Network, 2019).

      "  - context: ['[\" but extreme cases, there is even the risk that humanity could lose control of AI completely…\\\\n\\\\n…through the kind of AI sometimes referred to as ‘super intelligence’.\\\\n\\\\nIndeed, to quote the statement made earlier this year by hundreds of the world’s leading AI experts:\\\\n\\\\n“Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war”.\\\\n\\\\nNow, I want to be completely clear:\\\\n\\\\nThis is not a risk that people need to be losing sleep over right now.\\\\n\\\\nI don’t want to be alarmist.\\\\n\\\\nAnd there is a real debate about this - some experts think it will never happen at all.\\\\n\\\\nBut however uncertain and unlikely these risks are, if they did manifest themselves, the consequences would be incredibly serious.\\\\n\\\\nAnd when so many of the biggest developers of this technology themselves warn of these risks…\\\\n\\\\n…leaders have a responsibility to take them seriously, and to act.\\\\n\\\\nAnd that is what I am doing today – in three speciﬁc ways.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, keeping you safe.\\\\n\\\\nRight now, the only people testing the safety of AI…\\\\n\\\\n…are the very organisations developing it.\\\\n\\\\nEven they don’t always fully understand what their models could become capable of.\\\\n\\\\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-speech-on-ai-26-october-2023\\\\n\\\\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-speech-on-ai-26-october-2023\\\\n\\\\n4/12\\\\n\\\\n27/10/2023, 13:16\\\\n\\\\nPrime Minister\\'s speech on AI: 26 October 2023 - GOV.UK\\\\n\\\\nAnd there are incentives in part, to compete to build the best models, quickest.\\\\n\\\\nSo, we should not rely on them marking their own homework, as many of those working on this would agree.\\\\n\\\\nNot least because only governments can properly assess the risks to national security.\\\\n\\\\nAnd only nation states have the power and legitimacy to keep their people safe.\\\\n\\\\nThe UK’s answer is not to rush to regulate.\\\\n\\\\nThis is a point of principle – we believe in innovation, it’s a hallmark of the British economy…\\\\n\\\\n…so we will always have a presumption to encourage it, not stiﬂe it.\\\\n\\\\nAnd in any case, how can we write laws that make sense for something we don’t yet fully understand?\\\\n\\\\nSo, instead, we’re building world-leading capability to understand and evaluate the safety of AI models within government.\\\\n\\\\nTo do that, we’ve already invested £100m in a new taskforce…\\\\n\\\\n…more funding for AI safety than any other country in the world.\\\\n\\\\nAnd we’ve recruited some of the most respected and knowledgeable ﬁgures in the world of AI.\\\\n\\\\nSo, I’m completely conﬁdent in telling you the UK is doing far more than other countries to keep you safe.\\\\n\\\\nAnd because of this – because of the unique steps we’ve already taken – we’re able to go even further today.\\\\n\\\\nI can announce that we will establish the world’s ﬁrst AI Safety Institute – right here in the UK.\\\\n\\\\nIt will advance the world’s knowledge of AI safety.\\\\n\\\\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-speech-on-ai-26-october-2023\\\\n\\\\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-speech-on-ai-26-october-2023\\\\n\\\\n5/12\\\\n\\\\n27/10/2023, 13:16\\\\n\\\\nPrime Minister\\'s speech on AI: 26 October 2023 - GOV.UK\\\\n\\\\nAnd it will carefully examine, evaluate, and test new types of AI…\\\\n\\\\n…so that we understand what each new model is capable of…\\\\n\\\\n…exploring all the risks, from social harms like bias and misinformation, through to the most extreme risks of all.\\\\n\\\\nThe British people should have peace of mind that we’re developing the most advanced protections for AI of any country in the world.\\\\n\\\\nDoing what’s right and what’s necessary to keep you safe.\\\\n\\\\nBut AI does not respect borders.\\\\n\\\\nSo we cannot do this alone.\\\\n\\\\nThe second part of our plan is to host the world’s ﬁrst ever Global AI Safety Summit next week, at Bletchley Park – the iconic home of computer science.\\\\n\\\\nWe\"]']\n",

      "  - actual output: Removing conditionality in welfare benefits has the potential to have significant benefits on mental health and overall well-being. Studies have shown that when traditional welfare benefits with conditions are replaced with more supportive, tailored, and unconditional interventions, there are considerable improvements in mental well-being. This includes a reduction in feelings of stress, symptoms of psychiatric disorders, perceptions of stigma and marginalization, and overall improvements in mental well-being. Specifically, research in Finland showed significant increases in general life satisfaction and confidence in one's future when conditionality in welfare payments was removed. Overall, removing conditionality in welfare benefits can lead to improved mental well-being and overall well-being.\n",

It leads to a reduction in feelings of stress, symptoms of psychiatric disorder, perceptions of stigma and marginalization, and overall improvements in mental wellbeing and cognitive functioning. It also has no effect on the rate of employment or motivation for and attempts to secure employment. Preliminary evidence suggests that removing conditionality may also lead to a decrease in healthcare utilization and reduction in health-risk behaviors. Additionally, unconditional cash transfers for children have shown significant and long-lasting benefits in their mental health, particularly when introduced early. It improves parent-child relationships and allows parents to spend more quality time with their children.\n",

In Scotland, where close to a quarter of all children and a fifth of ‘working age’ adults live in poverty, public and political interest in UBI is growing. There is therefore a need for evidence on the potential benefits and drawbacks of the policy.\\\\n\\\\nUnfortunately, given the limited available evidence, it is not possible to draw any conclusions on the potential benefits or pitfalls of universal cash transfers. However, several pilots did directly compare the mental health effects of conditional versus unconditional cash transfers and their findings are striking. For adults, studies consistently found that removing the conditions associated with traditional welfare benefits was associated with improved mental wellbeing among participants, suggesting this holds considerable gains for population mental health. From a reduction in reported feelings of stress, symptoms of psychiatric disorder and perceptions of stigma and marginalisation, to overall improvements in mental wellbeing and better cognitive functioning, studies consistently reported clear and significant improvements in mental health when the conditionality\\\\n\\\\nremoved or replaced with more supportive, tailored, unconditional interventions.\\\\n\\\\nFurthermore, while UBI opponents assert\\\\n\\\\nthat the conditions associated with traditional welfare benefits are necessary in order to ensure individuals are motivated to return to work, in the studies we identified the removal of conditionality had no effect on either the rate of employment amongst recipients or their motivation for and attempts to secure it. Although the current review is limited to the previous UBI pilots, these findings echo the results of other benefit sanction reviews. In 2016, a comprehensive review by the National Audit Office concluded there was limited evidence sanctions actually worked and concluded the sanctions system was in urgent need of reform (National Audit Office, 2016). More recently, in the most extensive study of welfare conditionality in the UK ever conducted, sanctions were overall found to be ineffective at getting jobless people into work (Economic and Social Research Council [ESRC], 2018). Moreover, it emerged that they do little to enhance motivation to find employment and for some individuals, increase their risk of exposure to further poverty, ill-health and even survival crime (ESRC, 2018). Apportioning benefit sanctions based on the failure to comply with the current conditionality attached to Universal Credit would therefore appear\\\\n\\\\nassociated with traditional welfare was\\\\n\\\\nnot only detrimental to mental wellbeing,\\\\n\\\\n®\\\\n\\\\nMental Health Foundation Scotland\\\\n\\\\n21.\\\\n\\\\nThe mental health effects of a universal basic income - Conclusions\\\\n\\\\nbut also potentially harmful, ineffective and unnecessary.\\\\n\\\\nThere was also some preliminary evidence to suggest that removing conditionality is associated with a decrease in healthcare utilisation and reduction in health-risk behaviours, including alcohol and substance misuse. However more rigorous research is needed in order to definitively establish this, as well as further studies to determine the particular tenets of UBI which contribute to these reductions. Nonetheless, given the staggering human and financial cost of hospital admissions, as well as drug and alcohol misuse in Scotland, these results are of considerable interest.\\\\n\\\\nFinally, in the studies of unconditional cash transfers for children, we identified significant and long-lasting benefits in their mental health, particularly when these were introduced early. The detrimental effects of growing up in poverty for children’s mental health and overall development are well known. However, findings from Western Carolina indicate that income changes in isolation did not significantly mediate improved mental health outcomes for children. Rather it was increased parental supervision and an improvement in parent-child relationships due to reduced time constraints within the family which were central. As such, Scotland’s efforts to improve children’s mental wellbeing through reducing childhood poverty will be ineffective if the wider effects of all policies on children’s wellbeing are not evaluated. This must therefore be carefully considered\\\\n\\\\nmost effective strategies for improving children’s wellbeing, with implications that providing low-income households with non-stigmatising, unconditional payments offers parents the opportunity to spend more quality time with their children, with significant and long-lasting benefits.\\\\n\\\\nIn summary, it was not the purpose of this review to explore the economic impact or affordability of UBI, or indeed its ability to lift people out of poverty, rather our aim was to explore the impact of UBI-like schemes on mental health and wellbeing. Although none of the identified studies evaluated the mental health effects of a UBI in its purest sense, given none of these pilots were truly universal, our findings add an important contribution to our understanding of how the current welfare system could be improved to better support everyone’s mental health. Numerous reports have highlighted the detrimental mental health impacts the UK’s existing social security system holds for claimants.']\"]\n",
