This provides an average AIOE score for each industry, which are shown in Figure 2. In general, the industries more exposed to AI follow the same themes as discussed earlier in this report.\\\\n\\\\nThe finance & insurance sector is more exposed to AI than any other sector. This sector features a large number of finance and clerical roles which have high AIOE scores. There are five other sectors that are highly exposed to AI: information & communication\", ' professional, scientific & technical', ' property', ' public administration & defence', ' and education.\\\\n\\\\nThe industries least exposed to AI are accommodation & food services', ' motor trades, agriculture, forestry, and fishing', \" transport & storage and construction.\\\\n\\\\nSome of these industries capture a range of activities. For example, the veterinary activities sub-sector has much lower exposure to AI (average AIOE of -0.06) compared to the professional, scientific & technical industry as whole (average AIOE of 0.86).\\\\n\\\\nFigure 2: Exposure to AI by industry\\\\n\\\\nFinance & insurance Information & communication Professional, scientific & technical Property Public administration & defence Education All industries Health Wholesale Arts, entertainment, recreation & other services Production Business administration & support services Retail Construction Transport & Storage (inc. postal) Agriculture, forestry & fishing Motor trades Accommodation & food services -0.8 -0.6 -0.']\"]\n",

In Scotland, where close to a quarter of all children and a fifth of ‘working age’ adults live in poverty, public and political interest in UBI is growing. There is therefore a need for evidence on the potential benefits and drawbacks of the policy.\\\\n\\\\nUnfortunately, given the limited available evidence, it is not possible to draw any conclusions on the potential benefits or pitfalls of universal cash transfers. However, several pilots did directly compare the mental health effects of conditional versus unconditional cash transfers and their findings are striking. For adults, studies consistently found that removing the conditions associated with traditional welfare benefits was associated with improved mental wellbeing among participants, suggesting this holds considerable gains for population mental health. From a reduction in reported feelings of stress, symptoms of psychiatric disorder and perceptions of stigma and marginalisation, to overall improvements in mental wellbeing and better cognitive functioning, studies consistently reported clear and significant improvements in mental health when the conditionality\\\\n\\\\nremoved or replaced with more supportive, tailored, unconditional interventions.\\\\n\\\\nFurthermore, while UBI opponents assert\\\\n\\\\nthat the conditions associated with traditional welfare benefits are necessary in order to ensure individuals are motivated to return to work, in the studies we identified the removal of conditionality had no effect on either the rate of employment amongst recipients or their motivation for and attempts to secure it. Although the current review is limited to the previous UBI pilots, these findings echo the results of other benefit sanction reviews. In 2016, a comprehensive review by the National Audit Office concluded there was limited evidence sanctions actually worked and concluded the sanctions system was in urgent need of reform (National Audit Office, 2016). More recently, in the most extensive study of welfare conditionality in the UK ever conducted, sanctions were overall found to be ineffective at getting jobless people into work (Economic and Social Research Council [ESRC], 2018). Moreover, it emerged that they do little to enhance motivation to find employment and for some individuals, increase their risk of exposure to further poverty, ill-health and even survival crime (ESRC, 2018). Apportioning benefit sanctions based on the failure to comply with the current conditionality attached to Universal Credit would therefore appear\\\\n\\\\nassociated with traditional welfare was\\\\n\\\\nnot only detrimental to mental wellbeing,\\\\n\\\\n®\\\\n\\\\nMental Health Foundation Scotland\\\\n\\\\n21.\\\\n\\\\nThe mental health effects of a universal basic income - Conclusions\\\\n\\\\nbut also potentially harmful, ineffective and unnecessary.\\\\n\\\\nThere was also some preliminary evidence to suggest that removing conditionality is associated with a decrease in healthcare utilisation and reduction in health-risk behaviours, including alcohol and substance misuse. However more rigorous research is needed in order to definitively establish this, as well as further studies to determine the particular tenets of UBI which contribute to these reductions. Nonetheless, given the staggering human and financial cost of hospital admissions, as well as drug and alcohol misuse in Scotland, these results are of considerable interest.\\\\n\\\\nFinally, in the studies of unconditional cash transfers for children, we identified significant and long-lasting benefits in their mental health, particularly when these were introduced early. The detrimental effects of growing up in poverty for children’s mental health and overall development are well known. However, findings from Western Carolina indicate that income changes in isolation did not significantly mediate improved mental health outcomes for children. Rather it was increased parental supervision and an improvement in parent-child relationships due to reduced time constraints within the family which were central. As such, Scotland’s efforts to improve children’s mental wellbeing through reducing childhood poverty will be ineffective if the wider effects of all policies on children’s wellbeing are not evaluated. This must therefore be carefully considered\\\\n\\\\nmost effective strategies for improving children’s wellbeing, with implications that providing low-income households with non-stigmatising, unconditional payments offers parents the opportunity to spend more quality time with their children, with significant and long-lasting benefits.\\\\n\\\\nIn summary, it was not the purpose of this review to explore the economic impact or affordability of UBI, or indeed its ability to lift people out of poverty, rather our aim was to explore the impact of UBI-like schemes on mental health and wellbeing. Although none of the identified studies evaluated the mental health effects of a UBI in its purest sense, given none of these pilots were truly universal, our findings add an important contribution to our understanding of how the current welfare system could be improved to better support everyone’s mental health. Numerous reports have highlighted the detrimental mental health impacts the UK’s existing social security system holds for claimants.']\"]\n",

Rather they were granted to low-income households irrespective of employment status and the only condition applied to one of the study arms was the requirement to engage in a community- based group.\\\\n\\\\nAgain...\\\\n\\\\nIt is worth noting that, as contrasted with UBI pilots in other High-Income Countries, Finland’s Basic Income experiment was statutory and randomised, significantly increasing confidence in their findings. In addition, all of these findings were found to remain significant after controlling for sociodemographic variables, including gender, age, education, household structure and income.\\\\n\\\\nsignificant improvements in wellbeing among all four groups receiving B-MINCOME payments were observed in comparison with the control group who continued to receive standard benefits.\\\\n\\\\nBarcelona’s B-MINCOME study compared traditional welfare benefits, with the effects of four forms of cash payments, namely\", ' (1) cash payments received on an unlimited basis', ' (2) cash payments received on a limited basis (whereby they were incrementally reduced according to any household earnings in excess of the basic threshold)', ' (3) cash payments received unconditionally', ' and (4) cash payments received conditionally on the basis of involvement in a social programme (Kirchner et al. 2019). Although B-MINCOME had a complex study design,\\\\n\\\\nGeneral satisfaction with life, assessed according to a 10-point Likert scale, increased by 27% amongst B-MINCOME groups as a whole, and at the end of the study the probability of participants reporting a ‘high level of life satisfaction’ (rating their wellbeing as ≥ 7/10) was 11% higher amongst those receiving any form of B-MINCOME payment compared with those in the control group (Kirchner et al. 2019). Self-reported experiences of mental illness were also found to be significantly lower (9.6%), although it is not clear from the study reporting exactly how ‘experiences of mental illness’ were enquired about.

Interviews with participants also found that a renewed sense of hope for the future was ubiquitous among recipients (The Young Foundation, 2019', \" 2020).\\\\n\\\\nThe Netherlands Social Assistance Experiments sought to explore whether changes to social security payments could improve employment rates. As such, a sample of participants who were already in receipt of welfare benefits had their payments changed in one of three ways, with a control group who remained on welfare benefits as usual. In one group all conditionality surrounding social security was removed, in a second group increased help and guidance in finding employment was provided and in a third group recipients were allowed to earn extra money before their social security payments were withdrawn (Verlaat et al. 2020). A survey of all groups conducted at the end of the pilot identified positive treatment effects in terms of subjective wellbeing for all three interventions compared to the control group, although these did not reach statistical significance. However, a statistically significant treatment effect on participant’s self- efficacy (defined as a combined measure of self-confidence and perceived ability to find work) was found among both those who had had the conditionality\\\\n\\\\nsurrounding their benefits removed\\\\n\\\\nhad received additional help in finding employment (0.573, p=0.055) (Verlaat et al. 2020). In addition, in interviews, participants in both of these groups consistently reported increased wellbeing and a reduction in stress and anxiety.\\\\n\\\\nThe Ontario Basic Income Pilot (OBIP) was first launched in 2018, with the aim of providing a fixed income for three years to residents of three communities (Hamilton, Thunder Bay and Lindsay). Potential participants were those aged 18 to 64 who were living on low or no income, and data was collected from 4000 individuals receiving payments and 2000 control participants (Mendelson, 2019). Although, all of the tenets of UBI were therefore clearly not met, the pilot did provide a guaranteed, unconditional income equivalent to 75% of the Low-Income Measure (Mendelson, 2019).

Again, secondary analysis identified that the most significant factors accounting for this change, was an improvement in parental supervision (by 3-5%) due to reduced time constraints within the family.\\\\n\\\\n(28.6% vs 30.6%', ' p=0.014), with a reduction in alcohol (20.3% vs 23.8%', ' p=0.006) and cannabis use or dependence (16.7% vs 19.5%', \" p=0.049). On closer analysis these differences were most pronounced amongst the youngest EBCI study cohort (aged 12 at onset of casino dividends) who had had the longest exposure to the intervention, among whom there was a lower prevalence of psychiatric disorders (31.4%) in comparison with EBCI adults who had been older (aged 14) when payments were initiated (41.7%, p=0.005).\\\\n\\\\nFinally, one further study explored whether length of exposure to UBI-like payments in childhood (six years versus two years) resulted in differences in years of education, school attendance, probability of being arrested and probability of dealing drugs. They found that...\\\\n\\\\nIt is unfortunate that race/ethnicity in these studies was almost entirely merged with the intervention, making it difficult to differentiate the effects of the UBI like payments from the effects of being an EBCI member. However, it would appear race alone did not solely account for the observed findings, as onset and length of exposure to UBI-like payments were also of', ' welfare\\\\n\\\\nassistance payments they had previously\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n(0.489, p=0.047) and among those who\\\\n\\\\n®\\\\n\\\\nMental Health Foundation Scotland\\\\n\\\\n11.\\\\n\\\\nThe mental health effects of a universal basic income - Summary of study findings\\\\n\\\\nbeen receiving (Basic Income Canada Network, 2019\", \" Ferdosi et al. 2020). Both identified reported reductions in stress or anxiety (reported by 86-88% of recipients) and in symptoms of depression (reported by 73-83% of recipients). Improvements in self-reported mental wellbeing (80%), a reduction in feelings of anger (78%), improved self-confidence (81%) and a more hopeful outlook on life (86%) were also cited. Qualitative interviews with OBIP recipients similarly identified an alleviation of the stress and anxiety experienced under traditional welfare programs and a renewed sense of being able to make plans for their future, as a result of the financial security created by basic income (Hamilton & Mulvale, 2019).\\\\n\\\\nIn 1996, the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Indians (EBCI) in rural North Carolina introduced a casino on their reservation, which provided each of its roughly 15,000 inhabitants with a proportion of the profits (Costello et al. 2010). Payments were subsequently made to these members biannually, unconditionally and per capita, while children’s payments were placed in a trust fund which they could access when they reached 18 (Costello et al. 2010). This allowed for a natural experiment and longitudinal analysis, of differences in wellbeing among EBCI individuals\\\\n\\\\nin receipt of the casino dividends and\\\\n\\\\nindividuals from the surrounding area who had not. Subsequently, in 2019, Singh and colleagues explored the effect of these UBI-like payments on ‘self- reported lifespan’ (SRL) among young adults who had received casino dividends since childhood, compared with a sample of young adults who had not. Self-reported lifespan is a measure of an individual’s perceived life expectancy, with lower subjective survival indicating the anticipation of inevitable negative life events, with considerable implications for mental wellbeing.\\\\n\\\\nThe study found a mammoth 15.23-year mean increase in Self-reported lifespan among young men who had received payments compared with those who had not.\\\\n\\\\nWhile it was not the purpose of this review to explore the effects of previous pilots on rates of employment, given the main argument for applying conditions to the receipt of benefits is to encourage individuals to return to work, this is worth mention.\\\\n\\\\nIn none of the above studies was the removal of conditionality associated with a significant reduction in the rates of employment amongst recipients.\\\\n\\\\n®\\\\n\\\\nMental Health Foundation Scotland\\\\n\\\\n12.\\\\n\\\\nThe mental health effects of a universal basic income - Summary of study findings\\\\n\\\\nIn fact, most studies identified that no significant effect on employment was observed at all. In the Netherlands findings from all three intervention groups indicated slight, non-significant increases in labour participation compared with controls, with a particular increase in the percentage of people securing permanent contracts amongst those who had the conditionality associated with their benefits removed (Verlaat et al. 2020). Similarly, in Finland, researchers noted a non-statistically significant positive effect on employment, particularly in certain categories, such as families with children (Kela, 2020). In addition, a comprehensive review of basic income studies in North America, which included MINCOME, the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend, and the Eastern Band of Cherokees casino dividend program concluded there was no evidence to suggest an average worker will drop out of the labour force when provided with unconditional cash, even\\\\n\\\\nemployment among some groups do not reduce the overall labour supply since it is largely offset by increased supply from other members of the community (De Paz-Báñez et al. 2020).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nParenting and Child Mental Health, Wellbeing and Development\\\\n\\\\n1\\\\n\\\\nwhen the transfer is large (Marinescu, 2018).

MINCOME payments were not universal, nor were they individual, however they were granted to low-income households regardless of employment status, and 30% of Dauphin residents ultimately received them during the trial.

In Ontario a large percentage of recipients reported reductions in visits to health practitioners (33%) and hospital emergency rooms (37%) (Ferdosi et al. 2020). Conversely, in Finland, no difference in the reported number of hospital attendances or general practitioner visits were observed between groups (Kela, 2020).\\\\n\\\\nFurther analysis identified this reduction was primarily due to a significant fall in the number of admissions related to “accidents and injuries” and “mental health diagnoses”. Physician visits were also noticed to follow a similar trend, with a significant reduction in visits related to mental health diagnoses for the duration of the pilot.

Similarly, Costello and colleagues (2003) identified a 40% decrease in symptoms of behavioural disorders (such as conduct and oppositional disorders) amongst EBCI children who were lifted from poverty as a result of payments (p=0.002).

Both identified reported reductions in stress or anxiety (reported by 86-88% of recipients) and in symptoms of depression (reported by 73-83% of recipients). Improvements in self-reported mental wellbeing (80%), a reduction in feelings of anger (78%), improved self-confidence (81%) and a more hopeful outlook on life (86%) were also cited. Qualitative interviews with OBIP recipients similarly identified an alleviation of the stress and anxiety experienced under traditional welfare programs and a renewed sense of being able to make plans for their future, as a result of the financial security created by basic income (Hamilton & Mulvale, 2019).\\\\n\\\\nIn 1996, the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Indians (EBCI) in rural North Carolina introduced a casino on their reservation, which provided each of its roughly 15,000 inhabitants with a proportion of the profits (Costello et al. 2010). Payments were subsequently made to these members biannually, unconditionally and per capita, while children’s payments were placed in a trust fund which they could access when they reached 18 (Costello et al. 2010). This allowed for a natural experiment and longitudinal analysis, of differences in wellbeing among EBCI individuals\\\\n\\\\nin receipt of the casino dividends and\\\\n\\\\nindividuals from the surrounding area who had not. Subsequently, in 2019, Singh and colleagues explored the effect of these UBI-like payments on ‘self- reported lifespan’ (SRL) among young adults who had received casino dividends since childhood, compared with a sample of young adults who had not. Self-reported lifespan is a measure of an individual’s perceived life expectancy, with lower subjective survival indicating the anticipation of inevitable negative life events, with considerable implications for mental wellbeing.\\\\n\\\\nThe study found a mammoth 15.23-year mean increase in Self-reported lifespan among young men who had received payments compared with those who had not.\\\\n\\\\nWhile it was not the purpose of this review to explore the effects of previous pilots on rates of employment, given the main argument for applying conditions to the receipt of benefits is to encourage individuals to return to work, this is worth mention.\\\\n\\\\nIn none of the above studies was the removal of conditionality associated with a significant reduction in the rates of employment amongst recipients.\\\\n\\\\n®\\\\n\\\\nMental Health Foundation Scotland\\\\n\\\\n12.\\\\n\\\\nThe mental health effects of a universal basic income - Summary of study findings\\\\n\\\\nIn fact, most studies identified that no significant effect on employment was observed at all. In the Netherlands findings from all three intervention groups indicated slight, non-significant increases in labour participation compared with controls, with a particular increase in the percentage of people securing permanent contracts amongst those who had the conditionality associated with their benefits removed (Verlaat et al. 2020). Similarly, in Finland, researchers noted a non-statistically significant positive effect on employment, particularly in certain categories, such as families with children (Kela, 2020). In addition, a comprehensive review of basic income studies in North America, which included MINCOME, the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend, and the Eastern Band of Cherokees casino dividend program concluded there was no evidence to suggest an average worker will drop out of the labour force when provided with unconditional cash, even\\\\n\\\\nemployment among some groups do not reduce the overall labour supply since it is largely offset by increased supply from other members of the community (De Paz-Báñez et al. 2020).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nParenting and Child Mental Health, Wellbeing and Development\\\\n\\\\n1\\\\n\\\\nwhen the transfer is large (Marinescu, 2018).

In Scotland, where close to a quarter of all children and a fifth of ‘working age’ adults live in poverty, public and political interest in UBI is growing. There is therefore a need for evidence on the potential benefits and drawbacks of the policy.\\\\n\\\\nUnfortunately, given the limited available evidence, it is not possible to draw any conclusions on the potential benefits or pitfalls of universal cash transfers. However, several pilots did directly compare the mental health effects of conditional versus unconditional cash transfers and their findings are striking. For adults, studies consistently found that removing the conditions associated with traditional welfare benefits was associated with improved mental wellbeing among participants, suggesting this holds considerable gains for population mental health. From a reduction in reported feelings of stress, symptoms of psychiatric disorder and perceptions of stigma and marginalisation, to overall improvements in mental wellbeing and better cognitive functioning, studies consistently reported clear and significant improvements in mental health when the conditionality\\\\n\\\\nremoved or replaced with more supportive, tailored, unconditional interventions.\\\\n\\\\nFurthermore, while UBI opponents assert\\\\n\\\\nthat the conditions associated with traditional welfare benefits are necessary in order to ensure individuals are motivated to return to work, in the studies we identified the removal of conditionality had no effect on either the rate of employment amongst recipients or their motivation for and attempts to secure it. Although the current review is limited to the previous UBI pilots, these findings echo the results of other benefit sanction reviews. In 2016, a comprehensive review by the National Audit Office concluded there was limited evidence sanctions actually worked and concluded the sanctions system was in urgent need of reform (National Audit Office, 2016). More recently, in the most extensive study of welfare conditionality in the UK ever conducted, sanctions were overall found to be ineffective at getting jobless people into work (Economic and Social Research Council [ESRC], 2018). Moreover, it emerged that they do little to enhance motivation to find employment and for some individuals, increase their risk of exposure to further poverty, ill-health and even survival crime (ESRC, 2018). Apportioning benefit sanctions based on the failure to comply with the current conditionality attached to Universal Credit would therefore appear\\\\n\\\\nassociated with traditional welfare was\\\\n\\\\nnot only detrimental to mental wellbeing,\\\\n\\\\n®\\\\n\\\\nMental Health Foundation Scotland\\\\n\\\\n21.\\\\n\\\\nThe mental health effects of a universal basic income - Conclusions\\\\n\\\\nbut also potentially harmful, ineffective and unnecessary.\\\\n\\\\nThere was also some preliminary evidence to suggest that removing conditionality is associated with a decrease in healthcare utilisation and reduction in health-risk behaviours, including alcohol and substance misuse. However more rigorous research is needed in order to definitively establish this, as well as further studies to determine the particular tenets of UBI which contribute to these reductions. Nonetheless, given the staggering human and financial cost of hospital admissions, as well as drug and alcohol misuse in Scotland, these results are of considerable interest.\\\\n\\\\nFinally, in the studies of unconditional cash transfers for children, we identified significant and long-lasting benefits in their mental health, particularly when these were introduced early. The detrimental effects of growing up in poverty for children’s mental health and overall development are well known. However, findings from Western Carolina indicate that income changes in isolation did not significantly mediate improved mental health outcomes for children. Rather it was increased parental supervision and an improvement in parent-child relationships due to reduced time constraints within the family which were central. As such, Scotland’s efforts to improve children’s mental wellbeing through reducing childhood poverty will be ineffective if the wider effects of all policies on children’s wellbeing are not evaluated. This must therefore be carefully considered\\\\n\\\\nmost effective strategies for improving children’s wellbeing, with implications that providing low-income households with non-stigmatising, unconditional payments offers parents the opportunity to spend more quality time with their children, with significant and long-lasting benefits.\\\\n\\\\nIn summary, it was not the purpose of this review to explore the economic impact or affordability of UBI, or indeed its ability to lift people out of poverty, rather our aim was to explore the impact of UBI-like schemes on mental health and wellbeing. Although none of the identified studies evaluated the mental health effects of a UBI in its purest sense, given none of these pilots were truly universal, our findings add an important contribution to our understanding of how the current welfare system could be improved to better support everyone’s mental health. Numerous reports have highlighted the detrimental mental health impacts the UK’s existing social security system holds for claimants.']\"]\n",

      "  - context: [\"['\\\\nOverall, at the end of the study, almost a quarter of those who didn’ t receive UBI payments (24%) were found to have Mental Health Inventory scores indicative of a mental health difficulty, compared with less than one fifth of UBI recipients (17%) (p=0.001) (Kela, 2020).\\\\n\\\\nthe key distinction between B-MINCOME payments and traditional welfare benefits in Spain, was that they were not granted on the basis of being legally unemployed and providing proof of actively seeking employment. Rather they were granted to low-income households irrespective of employment status and the only condition applied to one of the study arms was the requirement to engage in a community- based group.\\\\n\\\\nAgain...\\\\n\\\\nIt is worth noting that, as contrasted with UBI pilots in other High-Income Countries, Finland’s Basic Income experiment was statutory and randomised, significantly increasing confidence in their findings. In addition, all of these findings were found to remain significant after controlling for sociodemographic variables, including gender, age, education, household structure and income.\\\\n\\\\nsignificant improvements in wellbeing among all four groups receiving B-MINCOME payments were observed in comparison with the control group who continued to receive standard benefits.\\\\n\\\\nBarcelona’s B-MINCOME study compared traditional welfare benefits, with the effects of four forms of cash payments, namely\", ' (1) cash payments received on an unlimited basis', ' (2) cash payments received on a limited basis (whereby they were incrementally reduced according to any household earnings in excess of the basic threshold)', ' (3) cash payments received unconditionally', ' and (4) cash payments received conditionally on the basis of involvement in a social programme (Kirchner et al. 2019). Although B-MINCOME had a complex study design,\\\\n\\\\nGeneral satisfaction with life, assessed according to a 10-point Likert scale, increased by 27% amongst B-MINCOME groups as a whole, and at the end of the study the probability of participants reporting a ‘high level of life satisfaction’ (rating their wellbeing as ≥ 7/10) was 11% higher amongst those receiving any form of B-MINCOME payment compared with those in the control group (Kirchner et al. 2019). Self-reported experiences of mental illness were also found to be significantly lower (9.6%), although it is not clear from the study reporting exactly how ‘experiences of mental illness’ were enquired about.

Interviews with participants also found that a renewed sense of hope for the future was ubiquitous among recipients (The Young Foundation, 2019', \" 2020).\\\\n\\\\nThe Netherlands Social Assistance Experiments sought to explore whether changes to social security payments could improve employment rates. As such, a sample of participants who were already in receipt of welfare benefits had their payments changed in one of three ways, with a control group who remained on welfare benefits as usual. In one group all conditionality surrounding social security was removed, in a second group increased help and guidance in finding employment was provided and in a third group recipients were allowed to earn extra money before their social security payments were withdrawn (Verlaat et al. 2020). A survey of all groups conducted at the end of the pilot identified positive treatment effects in terms of subjective wellbeing for all three interventions compared to the control group, although these did not reach statistical significance. However, a statistically significant treatment effect on participant’s self- efficacy (defined as a combined measure of self-confidence and perceived ability to find work) was found among both those who had had the conditionality\\\\n\\\\nsurrounding their benefits removed\\\\n\\\\nhad received additional help in finding employment (0.573, p=0.055) (Verlaat et al. 2020). In addition, in interviews, participants in both of these groups consistently reported increased wellbeing and a reduction in stress and anxiety.\\\\n\\\\nThe Ontario Basic Income Pilot (OBIP) was first launched in 2018, with the aim of providing a fixed income for three years to residents of three communities (Hamilton, Thunder Bay and Lindsay). Potential participants were those aged 18 to 64 who were living on low or no income, and data was collected from 4000 individuals receiving payments and 2000 control participants (Mendelson, 2019). Although, all of the tenets of UBI were therefore clearly not met, the pilot did provide a guaranteed, unconditional income equivalent to 75% of the Low-Income Measure (Mendelson, 2019).

Consisting of a periodic cash payment made on an individual basis to all, without means- testing or work requirement, the policy aims to end poverty through providing a financial safety net through which no one can fall (Tory & Jenner, 2019). In Scotland, where close to a quarter of all children and a fifth of ‘working age’ adults live in poverty, interest in the concept has surged, with four local authorities announcing proposals for UBI pilots in their respective areas (Danson, 2019\", ' General Register\\\\n\\\\nmounting support is the hypothesised potential for UBI to address the unacceptably high levels of mental health inequities which the country faces. The link between Scotland’s endemic poverty and its poor mental wellbeing is undeniable. Suicide rates are among the highest in the UK and rising (Pompili, O’Connor & Van Heeringen, 2020), and the country has become infamous as home to the highest drug related deaths in western Europe (Nicholls et al. 2019), with those living in Scotland’s most deprived areas shouldering the vast majority of the burden (General Register Office for Scotland, 2020). Therefore, for its proponents, UBI possesses not only the potential to improve the economic situation of individuals and their families, but through doing so to improve population mental health.\\\\n\\\\nOffice for Scotland, 2020).

Defining Features of a Universal Basic Income (BIEN, 2019).\\\\n\\\\nPeriodic - It is paid at regular intervals (for example every month), not as a one- off grant.\\\\n\\\\nCash payment - Paid in cash as opposed to in kind (such as food or services) or in vouchers dedicated to a specific use.\\\\n\\\\nIndividual - It is paid on an individual basis and not, for instance, to households.\\\\n\\\\nUniversal - Paid to all by virtue of their legal residence in a country.\\\\n\\\\nUnconditional - Paid without a requirement to work or to seek work.\\\\n\\\\n®\\\\n\\\\nMental Health Foundation Scotland\\\\n\\\\n4.\\\\n\\\\nThe mental health effects of a universal basic income - Introduction\\\\n\\\\nYet, the ability for UBI to achieve this continues to be fiercely debated. Vehement opposition from critics has questioned the affordability of such a policy and queried the value of UBI over other poverty alleviating strategies (Goulden, 2018', ' Downes & Lansley, 2018). Others have stressed the potential for this to divert funds currently targeted at those most in need and have cast doubt on UBI’s potential to redistribute wealth amongst the population, with economic modelling studies producing conflicting results (Nikiforos, Steinbaum & Zezza, 2017', ' Kozminski & Baek, 2017', ' Hoynes & Rothstein, 2019).\\\\n\\\\nHowever, the proposed mental health benefits of UBI do not merely centre on its debatable poverty alleviating potential. The universal, unconditional and individual tenets of UBI are also argued\\\\n\\\\nto hold unique benefits for population wellbeing. In the first instance it is argued that universal payments that are not targeted at particular social groups may forge increased social solidarity through reducing poverty stigma (Bueskens, 2017', \" Tory & Jenner, 2019).

Unconditional cash transfers have also been associated with better cognitive functioning and overall improvements in mental health.

In Scotland, where close to a quarter of all children and a fifth of ‘working age’ adults live in poverty, public and political interest in UBI is growing. There is therefore a need for evidence on the potential benefits and drawbacks of the policy.\\\\n\\\\nUnfortunately, given the limited available evidence, it is not possible to draw any conclusions on the potential benefits or pitfalls of universal cash transfers. However, several pilots did directly compare the mental health effects of conditional versus unconditional cash transfers and their findings are striking. For adults, studies consistently found that removing the conditions associated with traditional welfare benefits was associated with improved mental wellbeing among participants, suggesting this holds considerable gains for population mental health. From a reduction in reported feelings of stress, symptoms of psychiatric disorder and perceptions of stigma and marginalisation, to overall improvements in mental wellbeing and better cognitive functioning, studies consistently reported clear and significant improvements in mental health when the conditionality\\\\n\\\\nremoved or replaced with more supportive, tailored, unconditional interventions.\\\\n\\\\nFurthermore, while UBI opponents assert\\\\n\\\\nthat the conditions associated with traditional welfare benefits are necessary in order to ensure individuals are motivated to return to work, in the studies we identified the removal of conditionality had no effect on either the rate of employment amongst recipients or their motivation for and attempts to secure it. Although the current review is limited to the previous UBI pilots, these findings echo the results of other benefit sanction reviews. In 2016, a comprehensive review by the National Audit Office concluded there was limited evidence sanctions actually worked and concluded the sanctions system was in urgent need of reform (National Audit Office, 2016). More recently, in the most extensive study of welfare conditionality in the UK ever conducted, sanctions were overall found to be ineffective at getting jobless people into work (Economic and Social Research Council [ESRC], 2018). Moreover, it emerged that they do little to enhance motivation to find employment and for some individuals, increase their risk of exposure to further poverty, ill-health and even survival crime (ESRC, 2018). Apportioning benefit sanctions based on the failure to comply with the current conditionality attached to Universal Credit would therefore appear\\\\n\\\\nassociated with traditional welfare was\\\\n\\\\nnot only detrimental to mental wellbeing,\\\\n\\\\n®\\\\n\\\\nMental Health Foundation Scotland\\\\n\\\\n21.\\\\n\\\\nThe mental health effects of a universal basic income - Conclusions\\\\n\\\\nbut also potentially harmful, ineffective and unnecessary.\\\\n\\\\nThere was also some preliminary evidence to suggest that removing conditionality is associated with a decrease in healthcare utilisation and reduction in health-risk behaviours, including alcohol and substance misuse. However more rigorous research is needed in order to definitively establish this, as well as further studies to determine the particular tenets of UBI which contribute to these reductions. Nonetheless, given the staggering human and financial cost of hospital admissions, as well as drug and alcohol misuse in Scotland, these results are of considerable interest.\\\\n\\\\nFinally, in the studies of unconditional cash transfers for children, we identified significant and long-lasting benefits in their mental health, particularly when these were introduced early. The detrimental effects of growing up in poverty for children’s mental health and overall development are well known. However, findings from Western Carolina indicate that income changes in isolation did not significantly mediate improved mental health outcomes for children. Rather it was increased parental supervision and an improvement in parent-child relationships due to reduced time constraints within the family which were central. As such, Scotland’s efforts to improve children’s mental wellbeing through reducing childhood poverty will be ineffective if the wider effects of all policies on children’s wellbeing are not evaluated. This must therefore be carefully considered\\\\n\\\\nmost effective strategies for improving children’s wellbeing, with implications that providing low-income households with non-stigmatising, unconditional payments offers parents the opportunity to spend more quality time with their children, with significant and long-lasting benefits.\\\\n\\\\nIn summary, it was not the purpose of this review to explore the economic impact or affordability of UBI, or indeed its ability to lift people out of poverty, rather our aim was to explore the impact of UBI-like schemes on mental health and wellbeing. Although none of the identified studies evaluated the mental health effects of a UBI in its purest sense, given none of these pilots were truly universal, our findings add an important contribution to our understanding of how the current welfare system could be improved to better support everyone’s mental health. Numerous reports have highlighted the detrimental mental health impacts the UK’s existing social security system holds for claimants.', ' It is complicated, difficult to navigate and devoid of values of kindness, dignity or respect. Our findings would suggest that removing some of the existing barriers to accessing welfare benefits could lead to better population wellbeing and may reduce the prevalence of mental ill health. A range of models which remove the harsh conditionality currently associated with Universal Credit should therefore be explored, whether that be UBI\", ' a Guaranteed Minimum Income to ensure that household income cannot fall below a certain threshold', \" or a Negative Income Tax model. In addition, the included\\\\n\\\\nby policymakers when determining the\\\\n\\\\nstudies suggest that most people who will\\\\n\\\\n®\\\\n\\\\nMental Health Foundation Scotland\\\\n\\\\n22.\\\\n\\\\nThe mental health effects of a universal basic income - Conclusions\\\\n\\\\nbenefit from unconditional cash transfers will also engage in work to some extent. It is therefore crucial that such policies are also combined with those that promote the mental health of those in work, through ensuring fair and equitable pay, a better work-life balance and reducing employment insecurity. Our mental health is a powerful asset. It is a key that allows us to unlock a\\\\n\\\\nwide range of health and social advantages. Only through such transformational changes to the social welfare system and the world of work, will we be able to reduce Scotland’s mental health inequalities and unlock both the potential of both our current working age population, as well as the potential of future generations.\\\\n\\\\n®\\\\n\\\\nMental Health Foundation Scotland\\\\n\\\\n23.\\\\n\\\\nThe mental health effects of a universal basic income - Strengths and limitations\\\\n\\\\nStrengths and limitations D espite the promising findings of\\\\n\\\\nreport on this topic. In some instances, studies did not include a control group for comparison, making it more difficult to determine if the effects reported were the result of the UBI intervention. Finally, some studies were at risk of bias as a result of voluntary participation in the pilot, large percentages of participants dropping out, failure to properly account for multiple confounding factors and poor standards of reporting.\\\\n\\\\nand methodological flaws. In the first instance, research on UBI is limited and as demonstrated by this review, almost none of the pilots which have been conducted have explored the mental health impacts of a complete UBI, with all of its defining features. The majority of studies did not explore payments which were universal in nature, instead primarily focusing on those already in receipt of welfare assistance. Almost all studies were relatively short in duration, with a lack of more longitudinal studies limiting the ability to explore the relationship between UBI and mental health over time. In addition, the majority of the studies consist of cross-sectional self-reported surveys, with few employing objective or validated mental health outcome measures. This approach means that the findings may reflect higher or lower levels of mental health problems\\\\n\\\\nHowever, despite these limitations, several of the identified studies combined large sample sizes with rigorous study designs, providing credible evidence of effect and the majority of the identified studies were determined to be of medium quality. In particular, studies of the Casino Dividends granted to the EBCI provide robust evidence of the significant impact UBI can have on children’s long-term mental health, while the saturation sample investigated in Dauphin, allows for an interpretation of how such a policy may\\\\n\\\\ndepending on people’s tendencies to self-\\\\n\\\\naffect the population as a whole.\\\\n\\\\n®\\\\n\\\\nMental Health Foundation Scotland\\\\n\\\\n24.\\\\n\\\\nThe mental health effects of a universal basic income - Policy recommendations\\\\n\\\\nPolicy recommendations\\\\n\\\\n1. If and when pilots of redistributive unconditional cash transfer schemes, such as Universal Basic Income, a Guaranteed Minimum Income or a Negative Income Tax are implemented in Scotland, they should incorporate measures of recipients’ and children’s mental health and wellbeing in order to evaluate the potential mental health benefits of such schemes.\\\\n\\\\n2. Benefit sanctions, which often lead to unwanted stress and a worsening of mental health problems, should be halted entirely by the UK Government. In Scotland, to the extent that it is not possible to eliminate sanctions, the Scottish Government should continue to express its opposition to sanctions and continue to embark on a compassionate welfare system based on the values of dignity and respect.\\\\n\\\\n3. The stigma experienced by Universal Credit claimants should be tackled. This could be partially addressed by removing some of the barriers to accessing it, through reducing the 5-week wait for payments, making advance payments available immediately and removing the current requirement to repay them over the following 12 months. In addition, the UK Government’s proposals to end the Universal Credit uplift introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic should be dropped.\\\\n\\\\n4. The evidence supports positive mental health outcomes from unconditional benefits for children. In order to improve children’s prospects, existing unconditional benefits for children should be expanded by ending the two-child limit on tax credits and making parents of 0-3- year olds exempt from the benefit cap.\\\\n\\\\n5.

It is estimated that 10-30% of jobs are automatable with AI having the potential to increase productivity and create new high value jobs in the UK economy.1,2 The UK education system and employers will need to adapt to ensure that individuals in the workforce have the skills they need to make the most of the potential benefits, advances in AI will bring.\\\\n\\\\nThis report, produced by the Unit for Future Skills3 in the Department for Education, is one of the first attempts to quantify the impact of AI on the UK job market (separate to automation more generally). The research takes a methodology from a US based study developed by Felten et al4 and applies it for a UK context. The approach considers the abilities needed to perform different job roles, and the extent to which these can be aided by a selection of 10 common AI applications5. The methodology is extended further to consider the link between training and jobs impacted by AI, using a novel dataset that includes information on the qualifications held by young people in employment.\\\\n\\\\nResults should be interpreted with caution\\\\n\\\\nThe estimates of which jobs are more exposed to AI are based on a number of uncertain assumptions so the results should be interpreted with caution. Quantifying occupations in terms of abilities to perform a job role will never fully describe all roles and a level of judgement is required when interpreting the results. Further, the extent to which occupations are exposed to AI will change due to the pace at which AI technologies are developing and as new data becomes available.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, the themes highlighted by the analysis are expected to continue and provide a good basis for considering the relative impact of AI across different parts of the labour market.\\\\n\\\\n1 PwC, Will robots really steal our jobs? 2 The British Institute Academy, The impact of artificial intelligence on work 3 https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/unit-for-future-skills 4 Felten E, Raj M, Seamans R (2023) ‘How will Language Modelers like ChatGPT Affect Occupations and Industries?’ 5 Abstract strategy games\", ' real-time video games', ' image recognition', ' visual question answering', ' image generation', ' reading comprehension', ' language modelling', ' translation', ' speech recognition', ' instrumental track recognition.\\\\n\\\\n4\\\\n\\\\nSummary\\\\n\\\\nThis report shows the occupations, sectors and areas within the UK labour market that are expected to be most impacted by AI and large language models specifically. It also shows the qualifications and training routes that most commonly lead to these highly impacted jobs. The main findings are:\\\\n\\\\n• Professional occupations are more exposed to AI, particularly those associated with more clerical work and across finance, law and business management roles. This includes management consultants and business analysts', ' accountants', \" and psychologists. Teaching occupations also show higher exposure to AI, where the application of large language models is particularly relevant', '.\\\\n\\\\n• The finance & insurance sector is more exposed to AI than any other sector. The other sectors most exposed to AI are information & communication\", ' professional, scientific & technical', ' property', ' public administration & defence', ' and education.\\\\n\\\\n• Workers in London and the South East have the highest exposure to AI, reflecting the greater concentration of professional occupations in those areas. Workers in the North East are in jobs with the least exposure to AI across the UK. However, overall the variation in exposure to AI across the geographical areas is much smaller than the variation observed across occupations or industries.\\\\n\\\\n• Employees with higher levels of achievement are typically in jobs more exposed to AI. For example, employees with a level 6 qualification (equivalent to a degree) are more likely to work in a job with higher exposure to AI than employees with a level 3 qualification (equivalent to A-Levels).\\\\n\\\\n• Employees with qualifications in accounting and finance through Further Education or apprenticeships, and economics and mathematics through Higher Education are typically in jobs more exposed to AI. Employees with qualifications at level 3 or below in building and construction, manufacturing technologies, and transportation operations and maintenance are in jobs that are least exposed to AI.\\\\n\\\\nThe analysis measures the exposure of jobs to AI, rather than distinguishing whether a job will be augmented (aided) or replaced (substituted) by AI. Research by the International Labor Organization (ILO)6 suggests that most jobs and industries are only partly exposed to automation and are more likely to be complemented rather than substituted by generative AI like ChatGPT. Annex 2 maps the jobs highlighted in that report to the UK job market, and generally include customer service and administrative occupations, including call and contact centre and unclassified administrative occupations.\\\\n\\\\n6 Generative AI and jobs: A global analysis of potential effects on job quantity and quality (ilo.org)\\\\n\\\\n5\\\\n\\\\n1 Methodology\\\\n\\\\nThe methodology broadly follows the approach described by Felten et al7 to create an AI Occupational Exposure (AIOE) score, with some adaptations to make it suitable for a UK context.\\\\n\\\\n1.1 Selection of AI applications\\\\n\\\\nThe AIOE is constructed based on assumptions around the use of a defined set of common AI applications. The 10 AI applications selected are based on those where the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has recorded scientific activity and progress in the technology from 2010 onwards.\\\\n\\\\nTable 1: AI applications\\\\n\\\\nAI application Abstract strategy games Real-time video games Image recognition Visual question answering Image generation Reading comprehension Language modelling Translation Definition The ability to play abstract games involving sometimes complex strategy and reasoning ability, such as chess, go, or checkers, at a high level.

The recognition of events, relationships, and context from a still image. The creation of complex images. The ability to answer simple reasoning questions based on an understanding of text. The ability to model, predict, or mimic human language. The translation of words or text from one language into another. The recognition of spoken language into text.

Abilities are grouped under four categories: cognitive, physical, psychometer and sensory. Examples of abilities are oral comprehension, written expression, mathematical reasoning, manual dexterity, and stamina.10\\\\n\\\\nSOC 2010 was used instead of SOC 2020 to align with information on training pathways and due to known issues with SOC 202011. Updating the analysis to SOC 2020 will lead to small changes in the ordering of AIOE scores but not the overall findings.\\\\n\\\\n1.3 Assessing AI applications against human abilities\\\\n\\\\nAI applications are linked to workplace abilities using a crowd-sourced data set collected by Felten et al, and constructed']\"]\n",

Strategic Management Journal 42(12):2195–2217\\\\n\\\\n9\\\\n\\\\n1.7 Research by International Monetary Fund\\\\n\\\\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) have constructed a complementarity adjusted AI occupational exposure (C-AIOE) measure, where the exposure of occupations to AI are mitigated by their potential for complementarity.16\\\\n\\\\nAt a high level the authors of this study make an adjustment to the Felten et al methodology for AIOE17 to capture the potential to complement or substitute for labour in each occupation. They then apply both the original measure and the complementarity adjusted measures to labour force microdata (using ISCO-08) from 6 countries including the UK, with a particular focus on emerging markets.\\\\n\\\\nThe research finds that there are substantial cross-country disparities in the baseline AIOE, with emerging markets generally displaying lower exposure levels than advanced economies. This disparity is mainly due to different employment structures, with advanced economies characterised by larger proportions of high-skill occupations such as professionals and managers. In line with this report and as outlined by Felten et al, these professions are the most exposed to AI due to their high concentration of cognitive- based tasks. However, because those high-skill occupations also show higher potential for AI complementarity, these cross-country disparities in terms of potentially disruptive exposure reduce considerably once complementarity is factored in. Nevertheless, advanced economies remain more exposed even under the C-AIOE measure. Emerging markets with a large share of agricultural employment, remain relatively less exposed under both measures, as occupations in this sector have very low baseline exposure to AI. Overall, the results suggest that the impact of AI on labour markets in advanced economies may be more “polarised,” as their employment structure better positions them to benefit from growth opportunities but also makes them more vulnerable to likely job displacements.\\\\n\\\\n16 Labor Market Exposure to AI: Cross-country Differences and Distributional Implications (imf.org) 17 Felten E, Raj M, Seamans R (2023) ‘How will Language Modelers like ChatGPT Affect Occupations and Industries?’\\\\n\\\\n10\\\\n\\\\n2 Occupational exposure to AI\\\\n\\\\nThere is a range of UK and international research on AI and the impact that it will have on jobs and the labour market. It is very difficult to make a numerical estimate on a technology which is not yet fully understood and is evolving at a rapid pace. However, a consensus has begun to emerge that 10-30% of jobs in the UK are highly automatable and could be subject to some level of automation over the next two decades. However, the overall net effect on employment is unclear but it is often assumed that there will be a broadly neutral long-term effect and job displacement will be matched by job creation.18\\\\n\\\\nThis analysis assesses the relative exposure of UK jobs19 to AI by use of an AI Occupational Exposure (AIOE) score. The AIOE score allows jobs to be ranked to show which jobs are more and less likely to be impacted by advances in AI, based on the abilities required to perform the job.

This provides an average AIOE score for each geographical area or nation of the UK, which are shown in Figure 3.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, workers in London and the South East have the highest exposure to AI across any geographical area of the UK. They are also the only areas to be above the average for the UK as a whole. The North East is the area with the least exposure to AI across the UK.\\\\n\\\\nComparing London to the North East, the increased exposure is due to London having:\\\\n\\\\n• A higher proportion of professional occupations, including programmers, financial managers, and IT professionals.\\\\n\\\\n• A lower proportion of elementary trades, administration and services occupations, skilled trades, and caring personal services occupations.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, the variation in exposure to AI across the geographical areas is much smaller than the variation across occupations or industries. Each geographical area covers a large population and a lot of overlap in the types of jobs, so we would expect to see more variation in exposure to AI when looking at smaller areas where the job markets will differ more26.\\\\n\\\\nFigure 3: Exposure to AI by geography\\\\n\\\\nLondon South East United Kingdom East of England Scotland Northern Ireland North West West Midlands South West Yorkshire and The Humber Wales East Midlands North East ° fo) oS i lo) N 0.3 0.4 Average AIOE o wn 0.6\\\\n\\\\n26 At 4 digit SOC, between 55% and 80% of occupations within an individual geographical area or nation match the proportions seen for the UK as a whole.\\\\n\\\\n17\\\\n\\\\n4 Exposure to AI by qualification\\\\n\\\\nAn average AI occupational exposure score by highest qualification is estimated by linking together information on training with jobs. This is done using sample data that covers the qualifications held and training routes taken for young people in employment (age 23-30).27\\\\n\\\\n4.1 Training routes\\\\n\\\\nFigure 4 shows that early-career employees with higher levels of achievement are typically in occupations more exposed to AI. This aligns with findings from earlier in this report showing occupations labelled as higher skills levels were more exposed to AI. The same pattern is seen overall and across different training routes, for example apprenticeships, as shown in Figure 5. Female students are also in training that leads to more exposure to AI in jobs (overall their exposure score is 0.34 compared to 0.06 for males).\\\\n\\\\nEmployees that achieved apprenticeships at level 4 and above are in jobs most exposed to AI compared to any other route. However, this is based on a small sample, and the reference period for the data means it mainly includes the level 4 and 5 apprenticeship frameworks available before the introduction of new standards and growth in higher level apprenticeships from 2017 onwards. These apprenticeships were predominantly in accounting, professional services and IT, which typically are held by those in the occupations that are most exposed to AI.\\\\n\\\\nIn Annex 1, similar estimates have been made on the average exposure to AI using apprenticeship occupational maps and more recent data on apprenticeship starts. These estimates suggest employees with a level 4 or 5 qualification achieved through an apprenticeship are linked to jobs more exposed to AI than those that achieved similar level qualifications in Further Education or Higher Education settings.\\\\n\\\\n27 Longitudinal Education Outcomes study (LEO) linked to the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE).\\\\n\\\\n18\\\\n\\\\nFigure 4: Exposure to AI by highest level of attainment for early-career employees\\\\n\\\\nStudent average   \\\\n\\\\nFigure 5: Exposure to AI by training route28 for early-career employees\\\\n\\\\nStudent average   \\\\n\\\\n4.2 Subject areas\\\\n\\\\nThe tables below show more detail on the subject area for the highest qualification held by employees and show similar findings to earlier in the report around occupations and sectors most impacted by AI.\\\\n\\\\nEarly-career employees that achieved qualifications in accounting and finance at level 4 and above are in jobs more exposed to AI than any other subject area across Further\\\\n\\\\n28 Higher Education and Further Education refers to the education setting.\\\\n\\\\n19\\\\n\\\\nEducation or apprenticeships. Employees that achieved a level 7 or higher qualification in economics or mathematics and statistics are in jobs most exposed to AI across all subjects in Higher Education. This reflects a high number of learners with these qualifications ending up in professional occupations, including in the finance and insurance sector.\\\\n\\\\nThe employees with the lowest exposure to AI are those that achieved level 2 or 3 qualifications in building and construction, manufacturing technologies, and transportation operations and maintenance.\\\\n\\\\nTable 4: Subjects most and least associated with exposure to AI by further education setting\\\\n\\\\nTop 5 Level Level 4/5 Level']\"]\n",

Improvements in self-reported mental wellbeing (80%), a reduction in feelings of anger (78%), improved self-confidence (81%) and a more hopeful outlook on life (86%) were also cited. Qualitative interviews with OBIP recipients similarly identified an alleviation of the stress and anxiety experienced under traditional welfare programs and a renewed sense of being able to make plans for their future, as a result of the financial security created by basic income (Hamilton & Mulvale, 2019).\\\\n\\\\nIn 1996, the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Indians (EBCI) in rural North Carolina introduced a casino on their reservation, which provided each of its roughly 15,000 inhabitants with a proportion of the profits (Costello et al. 2010). Payments were subsequently made to these members biannually, unconditionally and per capita, while children’s payments were placed in a trust fund which they could access when they reached 18 (Costello et al. 2010). This allowed for a natural experiment and longitudinal analysis, of differences in wellbeing among EBCI individuals\\\\n\\\\nin receipt of the casino dividends and\\\\n\\\\nindividuals from the surrounding area who had not. Subsequently, in 2019, Singh and colleagues explored the effect of these UBI-like payments on ‘self- reported lifespan’ (SRL) among young adults who had received casino dividends since childhood, compared with a sample of young adults who had not. Self-reported lifespan is a measure of an individual’s perceived life expectancy, with lower subjective survival indicating the anticipation of inevitable negative life events, with considerable implications for mental wellbeing.\\\\n\\\\nThe study found a mammoth 15.23-year mean increase in Self-reported lifespan among young men who had received payments compared with those who had not.\\\\n\\\\nWhile it was not the purpose of this review to explore the effects of previous pilots on rates of employment, given the main argument for applying conditions to the receipt of benefits is to encourage individuals to return to work, this is worth mention.\\\\n\\\\nIn none of the above studies was the removal of conditionality associated with a significant reduction in the rates of employment amongst recipients.\\\\n\\\\n®\\\\n\\\\nMental Health Foundation Scotland\\\\n\\\\n12.\\\\n\\\\nThe mental health effects of a universal basic income - Summary of study findings\\\\n\\\\nIn fact, most studies identified that no significant effect on employment was observed at all. In the Netherlands findings from all three intervention groups indicated slight, non-significant increases in labour participation compared with controls, with a particular increase in the percentage of people securing permanent contracts amongst those who had the conditionality associated with their benefits removed (Verlaat et al. 2020). Similarly, in Finland, researchers noted a non-statistically significant positive effect on employment, particularly in certain categories, such as families with children (Kela, 2020). In addition, a comprehensive review of basic income studies in North America, which included MINCOME, the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend, and the Eastern Band of Cherokees casino dividend program concluded there was no evidence to suggest an average worker will drop out of the labour force when provided with unconditional cash, even\\\\n\\\\nemployment among some groups do not reduce the overall labour supply since it is largely offset by increased supply from other members of the community (De Paz-Báñez et al. 2020).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nParenting and Child Mental Health, Wellbeing and Development\\\\n\\\\n1\\\\n\\\\nwhen the transfer is large (Marinescu, 2018).

The first node discusses the direct link between UBI-like payments and childhood obesity rates, noting variable annual payments in Alaska. The second node elaborates on the specific reduction in obesity probabilities linked to income increases from UBI-like payments in Western Carolina. The third node covers health risk behaviors related to UBI-style payments, directly addressing the second part of the input question.

In Alaska, an additional $1,000 in accumulated payments reduced the relative probability of being obese as a three-year old by 5.2 percentage points. Similarly, receiving UBI-like payments in childhood in Western Carolina reduced the probability of obesity by 2-4% at age 21 for every $5,000 increase in annual household income.

MINCOME payments were not universal, nor were they individual, however they were granted to low-income households regardless of employment status, and 30% of Dauphin residents ultimately received them during the trial.

In Ontario a large percentage of recipients reported reductions in visits to health practitioners (33%) and hospital emergency rooms (37%) (Ferdosi et al. 2020). Conversely, in Finland, no difference in the reported number of hospital attendances or general practitioner visits were observed between groups (Kela, 2020).\\\\n\\\\nFurther analysis identified this reduction was primarily due to a significant fall in the number of admissions related to “accidents and injuries” and “mental health diagnoses”. Physician visits were also noticed to follow a similar trend, with a significant reduction in visits related to mental health diagnoses for the duration of the pilot. In addition, the decline in Dauphin hospitalisation rates relative to rates in the surrounding areas stopped when the trial ended, indicating MINCOME payments were at least partially driving these changes.

The human and economic costs of such health risk behaviours are vast. In Scotland specifically, where childhood obesity is endemic (Milovanska-Farrington, 2020) and drug related deaths are the highest in Europe (Nicholls et al. 2019), this is an area of particular interest where relatively small changes on an individual level may have wide ranging implications for population health. In addition, the link between physical health and wellbeing is well established and as such these findings are also pertinent to policymakers interested in the mental health effects of UBI.\\\\n\\\\nWhile not the focus of this review, a smaller number of the studies we reviewed explored\\\\n\\\\n®\\\\n\\\\nMental Health Foundation Scotland\\\\n\\\\n17.\\\\n\\\\nThe mental health effects of a universal basic income - Summary of study findings\\\\n\\\\nIn Alaska, longitudinal administrative data was used to explore whether variations in the value of UBI-like payments affected childhood obesity rates. This was possible as Alaskan payments vary annually with oil prices, and researchers were therefore able to explore whether differences in the cumulative amount received by age 3 affected obesity status. In doing so, they identified that...\\\\n\\\\ncontrolling for all other variables, an additional $1,000 in accumulated payments reduced the relative probability of being obese as a three-year old by 5.2 percentage points\\\\n\\\\n(Watson', ', Guettabi & Reimer, 2019).\\\\n\\\\nSimilarly, in Western Carolina researchers found that receiving UBI-like payments in childhood reduced the probability of obesity by 2- 4% at age 21 for every $5,000 increase in annual household income (Akee et al. 2013). However, it must be noted that these findings varied according to initial household socio- economic status, with an initial increase in BMI among children from lower income households. The authors concluded this suggests that not all of the negative effects of childhood poverty can be addressed by UBI. These observations also support the findings of recent study which analysed longitudinal data collected in Scotland and identified a positive association between maternal hours worked and child BMI, in addition\\\\n\\\\nto an increase in the likelihood of children being overweight or obese with increasing maternal hours worked (Milovanska- Farrington, 2020).\\\\n\\\\nAs policymakers and others often express concern that poor households may use UBI-like payments to buy tobacco, alcohol and other recreational substances, exploring the association between cash transfers and substance use is an area of particular interest (Gibson et al. 2018). Previous reviews of cash transfers in LMIC have identified that total expenditures on temptation goods actually reduce in response to UBI, suggesting that concerns about the use of cash transfers for alcohol and tobacco are unfounded (Evans & Popova, 2014). Yet few studies exploring the effects of cash transfers on drug or alcohol consumption in High Income Countries have been conducted (Gibson et al. 2018). A survey of cash transfer recipients in Ontario did identify that almost half (48%) reported a reduction in alcohol consumption. It has also been hypothesised that the large reduction in hospital attendances for “accidents and injuries” observed in Dauphin during the MINCOME pilot, may reflect a reduction in alcohol misuse (Forget, 2011). In addition, the findings from Western Carolina, where, as previously discussed, a reduction in the prevalence of substance use disorders amongst young adults\\\\n\\\\nwho had received UBI like payments\\\\n\\\\nsince childhood was identified, suggest\\\\n\\\\npayments may contribute to reducing\\\\n\\\\nsubstance misuse. However, other studies\\\\n\\\\nhave identified that infrequent, high value\\\\n\\\\n® Mental Health Foundation Scotland\\\\n\\\\n18.\\\\n\\\\nThe mental health effects of a universal basic income - Summary of study findings\\\\n\\\\npayments appear to lead to temporary spikes in the consumption of substances with implied benefits in staggering payments over the year (Evans & Moore, 2011\", ' Watson, Guettabi & Reimer, 2020).\\\\n\\\\nGiven Scotland’s unique relationship with alcohol and other recreational substances, clearly further research is needed to establish how the population may respond to such a form of social provision. However, these preliminary findings suggest the impact of UBI on drug consumption is largely influenced by the length of exposure to and the value of, cash transfers, with staggered payments beginning in childhood appearing to have\\\\n\\\\na beneficial effect.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nsocial divide (Tory & Jenner, 2019). Our\\\\n\\\\nfindings go some way to supporting this theory, with reports of increased social participation, reduced perceptions of stigma and enhanced relationships with family and friends being cited in several of the identified studies. In Finland, significant reductions in feelings of loneliness and an increased confidence in one’s ability to influence societal matters (28.9% vs 22.6%, p<0.0001) were found among recipients compared with controls (Kela, 2020). Similarly, in the Netherlands, enhanced perceptions of freedom, autonomy and social integration were identified during interviews with recipients who had had the conditionality associated with their benefits removed (Kool, 2019), while in Barcelona time spent on social activities or with family and friends significantly increased among recipients (Kirchner et al. 2019). A survey of recipients from Ontario also found improvements in social engagement, through increased time with family (57%) or on recreational activities (63%), as well as an increased sense of dignity (61%) and a reduction in feelings of marginalisation (47%) (Basic Income Canada Network, 2019). Finally, a qualitative evaluation of MINCOME identified widespread reports of psychological distress as a result of the\\\\n\\\\nSocial Cohesion and Social Participation\\\\n\\\\nperceived social stigma associated with\\\\n\\\\nreceiving traditional welfare benefits.\\\\n\\\\nThis contrasted with the experiences\\\\n\\\\nAccording to proponents, one of the key benefits of UBI is its unique ability to enhance social cohesion through reducing poverty stigma and narrowing the growing\\\\n\\\\nof MINCOME recipients, who reported\\\\n\\\\nincreased social participation and a\\\\n\\\\nlarge reduction in feelings of shame and\\\\n\\\\nstigma due to the avoidance of having\\\\n\\\\n®\\\\n\\\\nMental Health Foundation Scotland\\\\n\\\\n19.\\\\n\\\\nThe mental health effects of a universal basic income - Summary of study findings\\\\n\\\\ntheir work and personal lives monitored (The Young Foundation, 2019', \"2020).
