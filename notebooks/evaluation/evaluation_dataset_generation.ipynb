Information on where to make the corresponding changesin the the `core_api` service are at the bottom of this notebook. Once you make changes in `core_api` and rebuild, these changes will be reflected in the deployed /chat/rag endpoint."

MINCOME payments were not universal, nor were they individual, however they were granted to low-income households regardless of employment status, and 30% of Dauphin residents ultimately received them during the trial. The aim of this study was therefore to explore whether this change in the conditionality associated with receiving social security benefits had any spillover effects for wider population health in Dauphin, compared with surrounding areas where no such change occurred.

In Ontario a large percentage of recipients reported reductions in visits to health practitioners (33%) and hospital emergency rooms (37%) (Ferdosi et al. 2020). Conversely, in Finland, no difference in the reported number of hospital attendances or general practitioner visits were observed between groups (Kela, 2020).\\n\\nFurther analysis identified this reduction was primarily due to a significant fall in the number of admissions related to \\u201caccidents and injuries\\u201d and \\u201cmental health diagnoses\\u201d. Physician visits were also noticed to follow a similar trend, with a significant reduction in visits related to mental health diagnoses for the duration of the pilot. In addition, the decline in Dauphin hospitalisation rates relative to rates in the surrounding areas stopped when the trial ended, indicating MINCOME payments were at least partially driving these changes.

The human and economic costs of such health risk behaviours are vast. In Scotland specifically, where childhood obesity is endemic (Milovanska-Farrington, 2020) and drug related deaths are the highest in Europe (Nicholls et al. 2019), this is an area of particular interest where relatively small changes on an individual level may have wide ranging implications for population health. In addition, the link between physical health and wellbeing is well established and as such these findings are also pertinent to policymakers interested in the mental health effects of UBI.\\n\\nWhile not the focus of this review, a smaller number of the studies we reviewed explored\\n\\n\\u00ae\\n\\nMental Health Foundation Scotland\\n\\n17.\\n\\nThe mental health effects of a universal basic income - Summary of study findings\\n\\nIn Alaska, longitudinal administrative data was used to explore whether variations in the value of UBI-like payments affected childhood obesity rates. This was possible as Alaskan payments vary annually with oil prices, and researchers were therefore able to explore whether differences in the cumulative amount received by age 3 affected obesity status. In doing so, they identified that...\\n\\ncontrolling for all other variables, an additional $1,000 in accumulated payments reduced the relative probability of being obese as a three-year old by 5.2 percentage points\\n\\n(Watson\",\n",
      "            \", Guettabi & Reimer, 2019).\\n\\nSimilarly, in Western Carolina researchers found that receiving UBI-like payments in childhood reduced the probability of obesity by 2- 4% at age 21 for every $5,000 increase in annual household income (Akee et al. 2013). However, it must be noted that these findings varied according to initial household socio- economic status, with an initial increase in BMI among children from lower income households. The authors concluded this suggests that not all of the negative effects of childhood poverty can be addressed by UBI. These observations also support the findings of recent study which analysed longitudinal data collected in Scotland and identified a positive association between maternal hours worked and child BMI, in addition\\n\\nto an increase in the likelihood of children being overweight or obese with increasing maternal hours worked (Milovanska- Farrington, 2020).\\n\\nAs policymakers and others often express concern that poor households may use UBI-like payments to buy tobacco, alcohol and other recreational substances, exploring the association between cash transfers and substance use is an area of particular interest (Gibson et al. 2018). Previous reviews of cash transfers in LMIC have identified that total expenditures on temptation goods actually reduce in response to UBI, suggesting that concerns about the use of cash transfers for alcohol and tobacco are unfounded (Evans & Popova, 2014). Yet few studies exploring the effects of cash transfers on drug or alcohol consumption in High Income Countries have been conducted (Gibson et al. 2018). A survey of cash transfer recipients in Ontario did identify that almost half (48%) reported a reduction in alcohol consumption. It has also been hypothesised that the large reduction in hospital attendances for \\u201caccidents and injuries\\u201d observed in Dauphin during the MINCOME pilot, may reflect a reduction in alcohol misuse (Forget, 2011). In addition, the findings from Western Carolina, where, as previously discussed, a reduction in the prevalence of substance use disorders amongst young adults\\n\\nwho had received UBI like payments\\n\\nsince childhood was identified, suggest\\n\\npayments may contribute to reducing\\n\\nsubstance misuse.

However, these preliminary findings suggest the impact of UBI on drug consumption is largely influenced by the length of exposure to and the value of, cash transfers, with staggered payments beginning in childhood appearing to have\\n\\na beneficial effect.\\n\\n\\n\\nsocial divide (Tory & Jenner, 2019). Our\\n\\nfindings go some way to supporting this theory, with reports of increased social participation, reduced perceptions of stigma and enhanced relationships with family and friends being cited in several of the identified studies. In Finland, significant reductions in feelings of loneliness and an increased confidence in one\\u2019s ability to influence societal matters (28.9% vs 22.6%, p<0.0001) were found among recipients compared with controls (Kela, 2020). Similarly, in the Netherlands, enhanced perceptions of freedom, autonomy and social integration were identified during interviews with recipients who had had the conditionality associated with their benefits removed (Kool, 2019), while in Barcelona time spent on social activities or with family and friends significantly increased among recipients (Kirchner et al. 2019). A survey of recipients from Ontario also found improvements in social engagement, through increased time with family (57%) or on recreational activities (63%), as well as an increased sense of dignity (61%) and a reduction in feelings of marginalisation (47%) (Basic Income Canada Network, 2019).

In Scotland, where close to a quarter of all children and a fifth of \\u2018working age\\u2019 adults live in poverty, public and political interest in UBI is growing. There is therefore a need for evidence on the potential benefits and drawbacks of the policy.\\n\\nUnfortunately, given the limited available evidence, it is not possible to draw any conclusions on the potential benefits or pitfalls of universal cash transfers. However, several pilots did directly compare the mental health effects of conditional versus unconditional cash transfers and their findings are striking. For adults, studies consistently found that removing the conditions associated with traditional welfare benefits was associated with improved mental wellbeing among participants, suggesting this holds considerable gains for population mental health. From a reduction in reported feelings of stress, symptoms of psychiatric disorder and perceptions of stigma and marginalisation, to overall improvements in mental wellbeing and better cognitive functioning, studies consistently reported clear and significant improvements in mental health when the conditionality\\n\\nremoved or replaced with more supportive, tailored, unconditional interventions.\\n\\nFurthermore, while UBI opponents assert\\n\\nthat the conditions associated with traditional welfare benefits are necessary in order to ensure individuals are motivated to return to work, in the studies we identified the removal of conditionality had no effect on either the rate of employment amongst recipients or their motivation for and attempts to secure it. Although the current review is limited to the previous UBI pilots, these findings echo the results of other benefit sanction reviews. In 2016, a comprehensive review by the National Audit Office concluded there was limited evidence sanctions actually worked and concluded the sanctions system was in urgent need of reform (National Audit Office, 2016). More recently, in the most extensive study of welfare conditionality in the UK ever conducted, sanctions were overall found to be ineffective at getting jobless people into work (Economic and Social Research Council [ESRC], 2018). Moreover, it emerged that they do little to enhance motivation to find employment and for some individuals, increase their risk of exposure to further poverty, ill-health and even survival crime (ESRC, 2018). Apportioning benefit sanctions based on the failure to comply with the current conditionality attached to Universal Credit would therefore appear\\n\\nassociated with traditional welfare was\\n\\nnot only detrimental to mental wellbeing,\\n\\n\\u00ae\\n\\nMental Health Foundation Scotland\\n\\n21.\\n\\nThe mental health effects of a universal basic income - Conclusions\\n\\nbut also potentially harmful, ineffective and unnecessary.\\n\\nThere was also some preliminary evidence to suggest that removing conditionality is associated with a decrease in healthcare utilisation and reduction in health-risk behaviours, including alcohol and substance misuse. However more rigorous research is needed in order to definitively establish this, as well as further studies to determine the particular tenets of UBI which contribute to these reductions. Nonetheless, given the staggering human and financial cost of hospital admissions, as well as drug and alcohol misuse in Scotland, these results are of considerable interest.\\n\\nFinally, in the studies of unconditional cash transfers for children, we identified significant and long-lasting benefits in their mental health, particularly when these were introduced early. The detrimental effects of growing up in poverty for children\\u2019s mental health and overall development are well known. However, findings from Western Carolina indicate that income changes in isolation did not significantly mediate improved mental health outcomes for children. Rather it was increased parental supervision and an improvement in parent-child relationships due to reduced time constraints within the family which were central. As such, Scotland\\u2019s efforts to improve children\\u2019s mental wellbeing through reducing childhood poverty will be ineffective if the wider effects of all policies on children\\u2019s wellbeing are not evaluated.

      "            \", Guettabi & Reimer, 2019).\\n\\nSimilarly, in Western Carolina researchers found that receiving UBI-like payments in childhood reduced the probability of obesity by 2- 4% at age 21 for every $5,000 increase in annual household income (Akee et al. 2013). However, it must be noted that these findings varied according to initial household socio- economic status, with an initial increase in BMI among children from lower income households. The authors concluded this suggests that not all of the negative effects of childhood poverty can be addressed by UBI. These observations also support the findings of recent study which analysed longitudinal data collected in Scotland and identified a positive association between maternal hours worked and child BMI, in addition\\n\\nto an increase in the likelihood of children being overweight or obese with increasing maternal hours worked (Milovanska- Farrington, 2020).\\n\\nAs policymakers and others often express concern that poor households may use UBI-like payments to buy tobacco, alcohol and other recreational substances, exploring the association between cash transfers and substance use is an area of particular interest (Gibson et al. 2018). Previous reviews of cash transfers in LMIC have identified that total expenditures on temptation goods actually reduce in response to UBI, suggesting that concerns about the use of cash transfers for alcohol and tobacco are unfounded (Evans & Popova, 2014). Yet few studies exploring the effects of cash transfers on drug or alcohol consumption in High Income Countries have been conducted (Gibson et al. 2018). A survey of cash transfer recipients in Ontario did identify that almost half (48%) reported a reduction in alcohol consumption. It has also been hypothesised that the large reduction in hospital attendances for \\u201caccidents and injuries\\u201d observed in Dauphin during the MINCOME pilot, may reflect a reduction in alcohol misuse (Forget, 2011). In addition, the findings from Western Carolina, where, as previously discussed, a reduction in the prevalence of substance use disorders amongst young adults\\n\\nwho had received UBI like payments\\n\\nsince childhood was identified, suggest\\n\\npayments may contribute to reducing\\n\\nsubstance misuse. However, other studies\\n\\nhave identified that infrequent, high value\\n\\n\\u00ae Mental Health Foundation Scotland\\n\\n18.\\n\\nThe mental health effects of a universal basic income - Summary of study findings\\n\\npayments appear to lead to temporary spikes in the consumption of substances with implied benefits in staggering payments over the year (Evans & Moore, 2011; Watson, Guettabi & Reimer, 2020).\\n\\nGiven Scotland\\u2019s unique relationship with alcohol and other recreational substances, clearly further research is needed to establish how the population may respond to such a form of social provision. However, these preliminary findings suggest the impact of UBI on drug consumption is largely influenced by the length of exposure to and the value of, cash transfers, with staggered payments beginning in childhood appearing to have\\n\\na beneficial effect.\\n\\n\\n\\nsocial divide (Tory & Jenner, 2019). Our\\n\\nfindings go some way to supporting this theory, with reports of increased social participation, reduced perceptions of stigma and enhanced relationships with family and friends being cited in several of the identified studies. In Finland, significant reductions in feelings of loneliness and an increased confidence in one\\u2019s ability to influence societal matters (28.9% vs 22.6%, p<0.0001) were found among recipients compared with controls (Kela, 2020). Similarly, in the Netherlands, enhanced perceptions of freedom, autonomy and social integration were identified during interviews with recipients who had had the conditionality associated with their benefits removed (Kool, 2019), while in Barcelona time spent on social activities or with family and friends significantly increased among recipients (Kirchner et al. 2019). A survey of recipients from Ontario also found improvements in social engagement, through increased time with family (57%) or on recreational activities (63%), as well as an increased sense of dignity (61%) and a reduction in feelings of marginalisation (47%) (Basic Income Canada Network, 2019).

It is estimated that 10-30% of jobs are automatable with AI having the potential to increase productivity and create new high value jobs in the UK economy.1,2 The UK education system and employers will need to adapt to ensure that individuals in the workforce have the skills they need to make the most of the potential benefits, advances in AI will bring.\\n\\nThis report, produced by the Unit for Future Skills3 in the Department for Education, is one of the first attempts to quantify the impact of AI on the UK job market (separate to automation more generally). The research takes a methodology from a US based study developed by Felten et al4 and applies it for a UK context. The approach considers the abilities needed to perform different job roles, and the extent to which these can be aided by a selection of 10 common AI applications5. The methodology is extended further to consider the link between training and jobs impacted by AI, using a novel dataset that includes information on the qualifications held by young people in employment.\\n\\nResults should be interpreted with caution\\n\\nThe estimates of which jobs are more exposed to AI are based on a number of uncertain assumptions so the results should be interpreted with caution. Quantifying occupations in terms of abilities to perform a job role will never fully describe all roles and a level of judgement is required when interpreting the results. Further, the extent to which occupations are exposed to AI will change due to the pace at which AI technologies are developing and as new data becomes available.\\n\\nHowever, the themes highlighted by the analysis are expected to continue and provide a good basis for considering the relative impact of AI across different parts of the labour market.\\n\\n1 PwC, Will robots really steal our jobs? 2 The British Institute Academy, The impact of artificial intelligence on work 3 https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/unit-for-future-skills 4 Felten E, Raj M, Seamans R (2023) \\u2018How will Language Modelers like ChatGPT Affect Occupations and Industries?\\u2019 5 Abstract strategy games; real-time video games; image recognition; visual question answering; image generation; reading comprehension; language modelling; translation; speech recognition; instrumental track recognition.\\n\\n4\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nThis report shows the occupations, sectors and areas within the UK labour market that are expected to be most impacted by AI and large language models specifically.

Conversely, in Finland, no difference in the reported number of hospital attendances or general practitioner visits were observed between groups (Kela, 2020).\\n\\nFurther analysis identified this reduction was primarily due to a significant fall in the number of admissions related to \\u201caccidents and injuries\\u201d and \\u201cmental health diagnoses\\u201d. Physician visits were also noticed to follow a similar trend, with a significant reduction in visits related to mental health diagnoses for the duration of the pilot. In addition, the decline in Dauphin hospitalisation rates relative to rates in the surrounding areas stopped when the trial ended, indicating MINCOME payments were at least partially driving these changes. For policymakers in Scotland, where mental health and drug- related hospital admissions continue to soar, on a purely economic level, these findings\\n\\nHowever, of particular interest is the work of Forget (2011) who used health administration data to examine whether any changes in healthcare utilisation occurred\\n\\nshould be of considerable interest.\\n\\n\\u00ae\\n\\nMental Health Foundation Scotland\\n\\n16.\\n\\nThe mental health effects of a universal basic income - Summary of study findings\\n\\nFig. 1 - Hospitalisations per 1000 people by fiscal year.

The human and economic costs of such health risk behaviours are vast. In Scotland specifically, where childhood obesity is endemic (Milovanska-Farrington, 2020) and drug related deaths are the highest in Europe (Nicholls et al. 2019), this is an area of particular interest where relatively small changes on an individual level may have wide ranging implications for population health. In addition, the link between physical health and wellbeing is well established and as such these findings are also pertinent to policymakers interested in the mental health effects of UBI.\\n\\nWhile not the focus of this review, a smaller number of the studies we reviewed explored\\n\\n\\u00ae\\n\\nMental Health Foundation Scotland\\n\\n17.\\n\\nThe mental health effects of a universal basic income - Summary of study findings\\n\\nIn Alaska, longitudinal administrative data was used to explore whether variations in the value of UBI-like payments affected childhood obesity rates. This was possible as Alaskan payments vary annually with oil prices, and researchers were therefore able to explore whether differences in the cumulative amount received by age 3 affected obesity status. In doing so, they identified that...\\n\\ncontrolling for all other variables, an additional $1,000 in accumulated payments reduced the relative probability of being obese as a three-year old by 5.2 percentage points\\n\\n(Watson\",\n",
      "            \", Guettabi & Reimer, 2019).\\n\\nSimilarly, in Western Carolina researchers found that receiving UBI-like payments in childhood reduced the probability of obesity by 2- 4% at age 21 for every $5,000 increase in annual household income (Akee et al. 2013). However, it must be noted that these findings varied according to initial household socio- economic status, with an initial increase in BMI among children from lower income households. The authors concluded this suggests that not all of the negative effects of childhood poverty can be addressed by UBI. These observations also support the findings of recent study which analysed longitudinal data collected in Scotland and identified a positive association between maternal hours worked and child BMI, in addition\\n\\nto an increase in the likelihood of children being overweight or obese with increasing maternal hours worked (Milovanska- Farrington, 2020).\\n\\nAs policymakers and others often express concern that poor households may use UBI-like payments to buy tobacco, alcohol and other recreational substances, exploring the association between cash transfers and substance use is an area of particular interest (Gibson et al. 2018). Previous reviews of cash transfers in LMIC have identified that total expenditures on temptation goods actually reduce in response to UBI, suggesting that concerns about the use of cash transfers for alcohol and tobacco are unfounded (Evans & Popova, 2014). Yet few studies exploring the effects of cash transfers on drug or alcohol consumption in High Income Countries have been conducted (Gibson et al. 2018). A survey of cash transfer recipients in Ontario did identify that almost half (48%) reported a reduction in alcohol consumption. It has also been hypothesised that the large reduction in hospital attendances for \\u201caccidents and injuries\\u201d observed in Dauphin during the MINCOME pilot, may reflect a reduction in alcohol misuse (Forget, 2011). In addition, the findings from Western Carolina, where, as previously discussed, a reduction in the prevalence of substance use disorders amongst young adults\\n\\nwho had received UBI like payments\\n\\nsince childhood was identified, suggest\\n\\npayments may contribute to reducing\\n\\nsubstance misuse. However, other studies\\n\\nhave identified that infrequent, high value\\n\\n\\u00ae Mental Health Foundation Scotland\\n\\n18.\\n\\nThe mental health effects of a universal basic income - Summary of study findings\\n\\npayments appear to lead to temporary spikes in the consumption of substances with implied benefits in staggering payments over the year (Evans & Moore, 2011; Watson, Guettabi & Reimer, 2020).\\n\\nGiven Scotland\\u2019s unique relationship with alcohol and other recreational substances, clearly further research is needed to establish how the population may respond to such a form of social provision. However, these preliminary findings suggest the impact of UBI on drug consumption is largely influenced by the length of exposure to and the value of, cash transfers, with staggered payments beginning in childhood appearing to have\\n\\na beneficial effect.\\n\\n\\n\\nsocial divide (Tory & Jenner, 2019). Our\\n\\nfindings go some way to supporting this theory, with reports of increased social participation, reduced perceptions of stigma and enhanced relationships with family and friends being cited in several of the identified studies. In Finland, significant reductions in feelings of loneliness and an increased confidence in one\\u2019s ability to influence societal matters (28.9% vs 22.6%, p<0.0001) were found among recipients compared with controls (Kela, 2020). Similarly, in the Netherlands, enhanced perceptions of freedom, autonomy and social integration were identified during interviews with recipients who had had the conditionality associated with their benefits removed (Kool, 2019), while in Barcelona time spent on social activities or with family and friends significantly increased among recipients (Kirchner et al. 2019). A survey of recipients from Ontario also found improvements in social engagement, through increased time with family (57%) or on recreational activities (63%), as well as an increased sense of dignity (61%) and a reduction in feelings of marginalisation (47%) (Basic Income Canada Network, 2019).

Similarly, Costello and colleagues (2003) identified a 40% decrease in symptoms of behavioural disorders (such as conduct and oppositional disorders) amongst EBCI children who were lifted from poverty as a result of payments (p=0.002).

Both identified reported reductions in stress or anxiety (reported by 86-88% of recipients) and in symptoms of depression (reported by 73-83% of recipients). Improvements in self-reported mental wellbeing (80%), a reduction in feelings of anger (78%), improved self-confidence (81%) and a more hopeful outlook on life (86%) were also cited. Qualitative interviews with OBIP recipients similarly identified an alleviation of the stress and anxiety experienced under traditional welfare programs and a renewed sense of being able to make plans for their future, as a result of the financial security created by basic income (Hamilton & Mulvale, 2019).\\n\\nIn 1996, the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Indians (EBCI) in rural North Carolina introduced a casino on their reservation, which provided each of its roughly 15,000 inhabitants with a proportion of the profits (Costello et al. 2010).
