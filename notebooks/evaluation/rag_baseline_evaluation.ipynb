Low carbon energy also showed growth with both nuclear and wind, solar and hydro up on last year as a result of more favourable conditions and increased capacity.\\\\n\\\\n· Total final energy consumption (excluding non-energy use) was 0.2 per cent lower than in the second quarter of 2021, as warmer temperatures reduced demand and offset increased activity in the economy. Transport consumption rose by 23 per cent with petrol and diesel consumption returning to near pre-pandemic levels. Jet fuel consumption also increased but lies substantially below pre-pandemic levels. Service sector consumption fell by 3.0 per cent, whilst industrial sector energy consumption fell by 0.2 per cent. Domestic consumption fell by 28 per cent due to the warmer weather and a decrease in the amount of time working at home.\\\\n\\\\n· Exports of gas reached a new quarterly high as imports of Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) arriving in the UK helped supply Belgium and the Netherlands, with the volumes of the most recent quarterly exports exceeding many annual totals from previous years. Electricity exports also reached a new record high with the UK becoming a net exporter of electricity for the first time since 2010 as demand in France increased following reduced nuclear output in the French nuclear fleet.\\\\n\\\\n· Energy received from Russia decreased on the same quarter of last year. With no LNG cargoes arriving from Russia since March, Russia’s share of the UK’s gas imports fell from 7.6 per cent last year to 0. Russia’s share of the UK’s oil imports fell from 15.1 per cent to 3.7 per cent in second quarter of 2022.\\\\n\\\\n· Renewable generation rose 12 per cent on the same period last year due to more favourable conditions and increased capacity, particularly for wind. Renewable’s share of generation rose to 38.6 per cent, with low carbon’s share increasing 2.1 percentage points to 55.0 per cent with stronger output from nuclear. With stronger output from low carbon technologies, fossil fuel share of generation fell by 2.1 percentage points to 41.9 per cent.\\\\n\\\\n· Renewable generation capacity grew by 6.5 per cent on the same quarter last year, with offshore wind growing 23 per cent. The growth in renewable capacity has increased in recent quarters after a relatively sustained period of more modest growth. On a longer timeframe, renewable generation capacity is now six times greater than the same quarter of 2010.\\\\n\\\\nEnergy Prices\\\\n\\\\n· The consumer', ' Major Power Producers (MPPs) Renewables\\\\n\\\\nCoal Gas Nuclear UK production to a year earlier.

Natural gas production increased by more than 50 per cent, returning to near pre-pandemic levels. Oil production increased by 10 per cent and remans below pre-pandemic levels. Low carbon energy also showed growth with both nuclear and wind, solar and hydro up on last year as a result of more favourable conditions and increased capacity.\\\\n\\\\n· Total final energy consumption (excluding non-energy use) was 0.2 per cent lower than in the second quarter of 2021, as warmer temperatures reduced demand and offset increased activity in the economy. Transport consumption rose by 23 per cent with petrol and diesel consumption returning to near pre-pandemic levels. Jet fuel consumption also increased but lies substantially below pre-pandemic levels. Service sector consumption fell by 3.0 per cent, whilst industrial sector energy consumption fell by 0.2 per cent. Domestic consumption fell by 28 per cent due to the warmer weather and a decrease in the amount of time working at home.\\\\n\\\\n· Exports of gas reached a new quarterly high as imports of Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) arriving in the UK helped supply Belgium and the Netherlands, with the volumes of the most recent quarterly exports exceeding many annual totals from previous years. Electricity exports also reached a new record high with the UK becoming a net exporter of electricity for the first time since 2010 as demand in France increased following reduced nuclear output in the French nuclear fleet.\\\\n\\\\n· Energy received from Russia decreased on the same quarter of last year. With no LNG cargoes arriving from Russia since March, Russia’s share of the UK’s gas imports fell from 7.6 per cent last year to 0. Russia’s share of the UK’s oil imports fell from 15.1 per cent to 3.7 per cent in second quarter of 2022.\\\\n\\\\n· Renewable generation rose 12 per cent on the same period last year due to more favourable conditions and increased capacity, particularly for wind. Renewable’s share of generation rose to 38.6 per cent, with low carbon’s share increasing 2.1 percentage points to 55.0 per cent with stronger output from nuclear. With stronger output from low carbon technologies, fossil fuel share of generation fell by 2.1 percentage points to 41.9 per cent.\\\\n\\\\n· Renewable generation capacity grew by 6.5 per cent on the same quarter last year, with offshore wind growing 23 per cent. The growth in renewable capacity has increased in recent quarters after a relatively sustained period of more modest growth.

Jet fuel consumption also increased but lies substantially below pre-pandemic levels. Service sector consumption fell by 3.0 per cent, whilst industrial sector energy consumption fell by 0.2 per cent. Domestic consumption fell by 28 per cent due to the warmer weather and a decrease in the amount of time working at home.\\\\n\\\\n· Exports of gas reached a new quarterly high as imports of Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) arriving in the UK helped supply Belgium and the Netherlands, with the volumes of the most recent quarterly exports exceeding many annual totals from previous years. Electricity exports also reached a new record high with the UK becoming a net exporter of electricity for the first time since 2010 as demand in France increased following reduced nuclear output in the French nuclear fleet.\\\\n\\\\n· Energy received from Russia decreased on the same quarter of last year. With no LNG cargoes arriving from Russia since March, Russia’s share of the UK’s gas imports fell from 7.6 per cent last year to 0. Russia’s share of the UK’s oil imports fell from 15.1 per cent to 3.7 per cent in second quarter of 2022.\\\\n\\\\n· Renewable generation rose 12 per cent on the same period last year due to more favourable conditions and increased capacity, particularly for wind. Renewable’s share of generation rose to 38.6 per cent, with low carbon’s share increasing 2.1 percentage points to 55.0 per cent with stronger output from nuclear. With stronger output from low carbon technologies, fossil fuel share of generation fell by 2.1 percentage points to 41.9 per cent.\\\\n\\\\n· Renewable generation capacity grew by 6.5 per cent on the same quarter last year, with offshore wind growing 23 per cent. The growth in renewable capacity has increased in recent quarters after a relatively sustained period of more modest growth. On a longer timeframe, renewable generation capacity is now six times greater than the same quarter of 2010.\\\\n\\\\nEnergy Prices\\\\n\\\\n· The consumer']\"], retrieval_context=[\"[{'page_content': 'Energy received from Russia decreased on the same quarter of last year.

Natural gas production increased by more than 50 per cent, returning to near pre-pandemic levels. Oil production increased by 10 per cent and remans below pre-pandemic levels. Low carbon energy also showed growth with both nuclear and wind, solar and hydro up on last year as a result of more favourable conditions and increased capacity.\\\\n\\\\n· Total final energy consumption (excluding non-energy use) was 0.2 per cent lower than in the second quarter of 2021, as warmer temperatures reduced demand and offset increased activity in the economy. Transport consumption rose by 23 per cent with petrol and diesel consumption returning to near pre-pandemic levels. Jet fuel consumption also increased but lies substantially below pre-pandemic levels. Service sector consumption fell by 3.0 per cent, whilst industrial sector energy consumption fell by 0.2 per cent. Domestic consumption fell by 28 per cent due to the warmer weather and a decrease in the amount of time working at home.\\\\n\\\\n· Exports of gas reached a new quarterly high as imports of Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) arriving in the UK helped supply Belgium and the Netherlands, with the volumes of the most recent quarterly exports exceeding many annual totals from previous years. Electricity exports also reached a new record high with the UK becoming a net exporter of electricity for the first time since 2010 as demand in France increased following reduced nuclear output in the French nuclear fleet.\\\\n\\\\n· Energy received from Russia decreased on the same quarter of last year. With no LNG cargoes arriving from Russia since March, Russia’s share of the UK’s gas imports fell from 7.6 per cent last year to 0. Russia’s share of the UK’s oil imports fell from 15.1 per cent to 3.7 per cent in second quarter of 2022.\\\\n\\\\n· Renewable generation rose 12 per cent on the same period last year due to more favourable conditions and increased capacity, particularly for wind. Renewable’s share of generation rose to 38.6 per cent, with low carbon’s share increasing 2.1 percentage points to 55.0 per cent with stronger output from nuclear.

Low carbon energy also showed growth with both nuclear and wind, solar and hydro up on last year as a result of more favourable conditions and increased capacity.\\\\n\\\\n· Total final energy consumption (excluding non-energy use) was 0.2 per cent lower than in the second quarter of 2021, as warmer temperatures reduced demand and offset increased activity in the economy. Transport consumption rose by 23 per cent with petrol and diesel consumption returning to near pre-pandemic levels. Jet fuel consumption also increased but lies substantially below pre-pandemic levels. Service sector consumption fell by 3.0 per cent, whilst industrial sector energy consumption fell by 0.2 per cent. Domestic consumption fell by 28 per cent due to the warmer weather and a decrease in the amount of time working at home.\\\\n\\\\n· Exports of gas reached a new quarterly high as imports of Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) arriving in the UK helped supply Belgium and the Netherlands, with the volumes of the most recent quarterly exports exceeding many annual totals from previous years. Electricity exports also reached a new record high with the UK becoming a net exporter of electricity for the first time since 2010 as demand in France increased following reduced nuclear output in the French nuclear fleet.\\\\n\\\\n· Energy received from Russia decreased on the same quarter of last year. With no LNG cargoes arriving from Russia since March, Russia’s share of the UK’s gas imports fell from 7.6 per cent last year to 0. Russia’s share of the UK’s oil imports fell from 15.1 per cent to 3.7 per cent in second quarter of 2022.\\\\n\\\\n· Renewable generation rose 12 per cent on the same period last year due to more favourable conditions and increased capacity, particularly for wind. Renewable’s share of generation rose to 38.6 per cent, with low carbon’s share increasing 2.1 percentage points to 55.0 per cent with stronger output from nuclear. With stronger output from low carbon technologies, fossil fuel share of generation fell by 2.1 percentage points to 41.9 per cent.\\\\n\\\\n· Renewable generation capacity grew by 6.5 per cent on the same quarter last year, with offshore wind growing 23 per cent. The growth in renewable capacity has increased in recent quarters after a relatively sustained period of more modest growth. On a longer timeframe, renewable generation capacity is now six times greater than the same quarter of 2010.\\\\n\\\\nEnergy Prices\\\\n\\\\n· The consumer']\"]\n",
